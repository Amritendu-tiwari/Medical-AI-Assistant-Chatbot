## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see Installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-openai pypdf tiktoken faiss-cpu openai streamlit python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Process the medical documents:**
   ```bash
   cd src
   python ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Generate embeddings and create vector store:**
   ```bash
   python embed_index.py
   ```

3. **Test the retrieval system:**
   ```bash
   python retriever.py
   ```

4. **Test the QA chain:**
   ```bash
   python qa.py
   ```

5. **Launch the Streamlit interface:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä Data Sources

The chatbot is trained on authoritative medical documents from:

- **CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)**
  - Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers information
  - Infection control recommendations
  - Micronutrient facts and nutrition guidelines

- **WHO (World Health Organization)**
  - Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition

- **American Red Cross**
  - First aid guidelines and procedures

## üîß Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Document Loading**: Uses Langchain's document loaders for PDFs and text files
- **Text Chunking**: Splits documents into 400-600 token chunks with 100-token overlap
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains source information and page numbers

### 2. Vector Database and Retrieval
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Retrieval**: Returns top 5 most relevant chunks for each query

### 3. LLM Integration and Safety
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts with medical disclaimers
- **Safety Measures**: Built-in refusal mechanisms for inappropriate requests

### 4. User Interface
- **Framework**: Streamlit for interactive web interface
- **Features**: Chat history, source display, clear disclaimers
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Medical Disclaimers
Every response includes a persistent disclaimer:
> "This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. Please consult a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns."

### Ethical Boundaries
The chatbot is programmed to:
- ‚ùå **Refuse diagnoses**: "I cannot provide medical diagnoses"
- ‚ùå **Refuse prescriptions**: "I cannot prescribe medications"
- ‚ùå **Refuse specific medical advice**: Redirects to healthcare professionals
- ‚ùå **Handle out-of-scope queries**: Politely declines non-medical questions

### Source Transparency
- Shows retrieved document sources for each response
- Provides content snippets for verification
- Maintains traceability to original medical literature

## üìù Example Interactions

See `examples/sample_responses.md` for detailed examples of:
- ‚úÖ Appropriate medical information queries

- **General Information Only**: Provides general medical knowledge, not personalized advice
- **Source Dependent**: Quality of responses depends on the quality of source documents
- **Technology Limitations**: AI systems can make errors or provide incomplete information

### Usage Guidelines
- Use for general medical education and information only
- Always verify information with healthcare professionals
- Do not use for emergency medical situations
- Consult doctors for any health concerns or symptoms

## üìÑ License
