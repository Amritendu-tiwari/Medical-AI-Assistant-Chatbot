    "text": "Medical portal First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with a medical emergency , [ 1 ] with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical or first response training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, [ 2 ] while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD . [ 3 ] Conflict first aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual's social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada . There are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance, which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator ), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. Generally, five steps are associated with first aid: Assess the surrounding areas. Move to a safe surrounding (if not already; for example, road accidents are unsafe to be dealt with on roads). Call for help: both professional medical help and people nearby who might help in first aid such as the compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Perform suitable first aid depending on the injury suffered by the casualty. Evaluate the casualty for any fatal signs of danger, or possibility of performing the first aid again. Early history and warfare Skills of what is now known as first aid have been recorded throughout history, especially in relation to warfare , where the care of both traumatic and medical cases is required in particularly large numbers. The bandaging of battle wounds is shown on Classical Greek pottery from c. 500 BC , whilst the parable of the Good Samaritan includes references to binding or dressing wounds. [ 4 ] There are numerous references to first aid performed within the Roman army , with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals. [ 5 ] Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern combat medic . [ 6 ] Further examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to",

[ 6 ] Further examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the Holy Land . [ 7 ] Formalization of life saving treatments During the late 18th century, drowning as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in Amsterdam , and in 1773, physician William Hawes began publicizing the power of artificial respiration as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned. This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned , later the Royal Humane Society , who did much to promote resuscitation. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Napoleon 's surgeon, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey , is credited with creating an ambulance corps, the ambulance volantes , which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle. [ 10 ] In 1859, Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino , and his work led to the formation of the Red Cross , with a key stated aim of \"aid to sick and wounded soldiers in the field\". [ 7 ] The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide. [ 11 ] In 1870, Prussian military surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term \"erste hilfe\" (translating to 'first aid'), including training for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the Esmarch bandage which he designed. [ 4 ] The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses.

[ 4 ] The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses. In 1872, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England changed its focus from hospice care, and set out to start a system of practical medical help, starting with making a grant towards the establishment of the UK's first ambulance service. This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day St John Ambulance ) \"to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded\". [ 12 ] Also in the UK, Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd had seen the advantages of von Esmarch's new teaching of first aid, and introduced an equivalent programme for the British Army, and so being the first user of \"first aid for the injured\" in English, disseminating information through a series of lectures. Following this, in 1878, Shepherd and Colonel Francis Duncan took advantage of the newly charitable focus of St John, [ 4 ] and established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians. The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum. First aid training began to spread through the British Empire through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways. [ 13 ] The first recorded first aid training in the United States took place in Jermyn, Pennsylvania in 1899.

Diabetes, hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia or hyperglycaemia is a condition in which an excessive level of glucose is present in the blood. Diabetes, hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia or hypoglycaemia is a condition in which an excessively low level of glucose is present in the blood. It typically occurs due to complications with medication used to reduce blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Drowning Drowning in humans is a type of suffocation caused by both the nose and mouth being submerged in liquid. The first aid for drowning is very similar to that of cardiorespiratory arrest. Infarction of the heart A myocardial infarction , commonly known as a heart attack , is the sudden reduction in or lack of blood flow in one of the coronary arteries in the heart, causing infarction (tissue death due to inadequate blood supply). Risk factors for myocardial infarctions include living a sedentary lifestyle, age (being over 45 for men and 55 for women), tobacco and alcohol use, stress, obesity, high cholesterol, family history, and diabetes. [ 15 ] Stroke A stroke is a sudden lack of blood supply to the brain caused by a burst or blocked artery. [ 16 ] Aims of first aid The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of 'the three Ps': [ 17 ] Preserve life: The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death. First aid done correctly should help reduce the patient's level of pain and calm them down during the evaluation and treatment process. Prevent further harm: Prevention of further harm includes addressing both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed from becoming dangerous.

Promote recovery: First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound. First aid is not medical treatment, and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person. Setting the priorities A first aid intervention would follow an order, which would try to attend in the best manner the main threats for the life and mobility of the victim. There are some first aid protocols (such as ATLS, BATLS and SAFE-POINT) that define which are the priorities and the correct execution of the steps for saving human life. A major benefit of the use of official protocols is that they require minimum resources, time and skills, and have a great degree of success. ABCDE and csABCDE general protocol The ABCDE method is the general protocol of first aid and implies a quite general view. [ 18 ] It was initially developed by Dr Peter Safar in the 1950s. But it has received some modifications, improvements and variations that were intended for more specific contexts. For example: it has been completed with improvements from the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the American College of Surgeons [ 19 ] and the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the British Army. [ 20 ] As a result, the mnemonic of the steps of this protocol is ABCDE , or its improved version (cs)ABCDE (sometimes called xABCDE , the words in the mnemonic may vary), which represent: [ 21 ] [ 22 ] —An attached first part (named as \"cs\" or \"x\", or in any other way) that will always mention stopping the critical losses of blood and managing with a special and careful treatment to patients with serious damages at the spine that threaten their future mobility: catastrophic-bleeding (stopping urgently the massive external bleedings, as it is marked in the BATLS version). spine-protection (",

Breathing (ensuring respiration). Circulation (ensuring effective cardiac output). Any Defibrillation process for a cardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat) would be included here, or in 'Disability' (as a double mnemonic 'D'). Disability (neurological condition, level of glucose can also be examined). Exposure (or 'Evaluate': other questions in an overall examination of the patient, environment). ABC and CABD cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol This protocol (originally named as ABC ) is a simplified version or concrete application of the previous csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, that focuses in the use of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation . The American Heart Association and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation teach it as a reference. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Its current mnemonic is CABD (an improvement in the sequence for most of the cases): Circulation or Chest Compressions. Airway : attempt to open the airway (using a head-tilt and chin-lift technique; not in the case of babies, which require avoid tilting the head). Breathing or Rescue Breaths . Defibrillation : use of an automated external defibrillator to recover heart function. Wider protocols These are the protocols that do not only deal with direct care to the victim but they also mention other complementary tasks (before and later).

The CABD (or ABC) method for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and many details of the wider csABCDE (or ABCDE) method would be included in this step. Other mentionable protocols Some other known protocols that could be mentioned in many contexts (in alphabetical order): AMEGA protocol It is similar to the European protocol, because it also has a wider range [ 26 ] than the common csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, and includes other tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves. The order of the steps is changed, and the experience with it is lesser, but it adds the idea of a posterior 'aftermath' phase. The mnemonic AMEGA refers to: Assess the situation, looking for risks. Make safe the situation, after having identified the risks. Emergency aid . Performing the first aid practices. Get help . Asking for emergency help to medical services and bystanders. Aftermath . The aftermath tasks include recording and reporting, continued care of patients and the welfare of responders and the replacement of used first aid kit elements.

The preference for one or another among all these protocols can depend on the context and the audience. It comes from Red Cross [ 27 ] and, as the European protocol, has a wider range than the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method. So it could be seen as a simplification of the European protocol, and, especially, easier to remember as a guide for most of cases.

Key basic skills Certain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously. Displacement skills If there are dangers around (such as fire, electric dangers or others) the patient has to be moved to a safe place, [ 29 ] [ 30 ] (if it is safe for the first aid provider to do so), where providing the required first aid procedures is possible. — In case of a possible severe spinal injury: when a patient seems to have a possible serious injury in the spinal cord (in the backbone, either at the neck part or the back part), that patient must not be moved except if that is necessary, and, when necessary, it must be done as little as possible and very carefully (see mentions about this type of injury in the gallery of drawings below).

These precautions avoid many risks of causing further damages for the patient's mobility in the future. Usually, the patient needs to end up lying down, in a face-up position, on a sufficiently firm surface (for example, on the floor, which allows to perform the chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation). —A victim with a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck), which indicates a risk to the future mobility, can be carefully transferred by several rescuers that work coordinately. The victim’s head and back would be held in the same position they were. —When there is a victim with a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck) and a rescuer without instruments, the rescuer can try to carry the victim carefully through the Rautek maneuver (as in the picture), trying to keep victim’s head and back in the same position they were. The victim's head can be supported on the rescuer to try to soften the movements. A second rescuer can hold the legs. —A victim without a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck) can be pulled through the floor, which is easier on a blanket, carpet or another tissue located under most of the body. —Carrying on a base to victims with a suspected spinal injury would require to place them carefully, while keeping their head and back in the same position they were, on a higher or much thicker base (as a litter or mattress), for a better displacement. Checking skills They evaluate the condition of the victim, [ 29 ] first attending to the main threats for life. The preferred initial way of checking consist of asking, commonly by touching the patient in one of his shoulders and shouting something, such as: \"can you hear me?\" In some cases, the victim has a wound that bleeds abundantly, which requires its own additional treatment to stop the blood loss (usually, it would begin by keeping the wound pressed).

If the patient does not react, the heartbeats can be checked in the carotid pulse: placing two fingers on any side of the neck (on the left or the right side), near his head. In cases where checking the carotid pulse is impossible, heartbeats can be perceived in the radial pulse: placing two fingers on a wrist, under the part of the thumb, and applying moderate pressure. Breathing can also be checked additionally, placing an ear on the mouth and, at the same time, watching the chest rising by the effect of the air. It is recommended not to waste too much time of first aid in checking (professional rescuers are taught to take 10 seconds in it). Checking of heartbeats in the carotid pulse. This is usually the fastest method of checking the patient's condition. Verification of heartbeats in the radial pulse, pressing moderately on a wrist, under the part of the thumb. Check of patient's breathing, listening the air inside of the mouth and watching the chest swelling. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the method of first aid for treating victims of cardiac arrest (complete stop of heartbeat). Airway, Breathing, and Circulation skills ABC method stands for Airway , Breathing , and Circulation . [ 31 ] The same mnemonic is used by emergency health professionals . It is focused on critical life-saving intervention, and it must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries. Attention must first be brought to the airway to ensure it is clear . An obstruction (choking) is a life-threatening emergency. If an object blocks the airway, it requires anti-choking procedures . Following any evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of breathing and provide rescue breathing if safe to do so. Assessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients.",

Assessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients. Some organizations add a fourth step of \"D\" for Deadly bleeding or Defibrillation , while others consider this as part of the Circulation step simply referred as Disability. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider. Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments or examination, as required if they possess the proper training (such as measuring pupil dilation). [ 32 ] Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the \"3Bs\": Breathing , Bleeding , and Bones (or \"4Bs\": Breathing , Bleeding , Burns , and Bones ). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both artificial respiration and chest compressions to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of cervical spine injuries when ensuring an open airway. The patient must have an open airway—that is, an unobstructed passage that allows air to travel from the open mouth or uncongested nose , down through the pharynx and into the lungs. Conscious people maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to do so, as the part of the brain that manages spontaneous breathing may not be functioning. Whether conscious or not, the patient may be placed in the recovery position , laying on their side. In addition to relaxing the patient, this can have the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx . It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents. The airway can also become blocked by a foreign object. To dislodge the object and solve the choking case, the first aider may use anti-choking methods (such as 'back slaps, 'chest thrusts' or 'abdominal thrust",

To dislodge the object and solve the choking case, the first aider may use anti-choking methods (such as 'back slaps, 'chest thrusts' or 'abdominal thrusts'). Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would reassess the patient's breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally (e.g., agonal breathing ), the first aider would initiate CPR , which attempts to restart the patient's breathing by forcing air into the lungs. They may also manually massage the heart to promote blood flow around the body. If the choking person is an infant, the first aider may use anti-choking methods for babies. During that procedure, series of five strong blows are delivered on the infant's upper back after placing the infant's face in the aider's forearm. If the infant is able to cough or cry, no breathing assistance should be given. Chest thrusts can also be applied with two fingers on the lower half of the middle of the chest. Coughing and crying indicate the airway is open and the foreign object will likely to come out from the force the coughing or crying produces. [ 33 ] A first responder should know how to use an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) in the case of a person having a sudden cardiac arrest. The survival rate of those who have a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is low. Permanent brain damage sets in after five minutes of no oxygen delivery, so rapid action on the part of the rescuer is necessary. An AED is a device that can examine a heartbeat and produce electric shocks to restart the heart.

A first aid kit does not have to be bought ready-made. The advantage of ready-made first aid kits are that they have well organized compartments and familiar layouts. Contents There is no universal agreement upon the list for the contents of a first aid kit. The UK Health and Safety Executive stress that the contents of workplace first aid kits will vary according to the nature of the work activities. [ 35 ] As an example of possible contents of a kit, British Standard BS 8599 First Aid Kits for the Workplace [ 36 ] lists the following items: Information leaflet Medium sterile dressings Large sterile dressings Bandages Triangular dressings Safety pins Adhesive dressings Sterile wet wipes Microporous tape Nitrile gloves Face shield Foil blanket Burn dressings Clothing shears Conforming bandages Finger dressing Antiseptic cream Scissors Tweezers Cotton Training principles Basic principles, such as knowing the use of adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs before an actual emergency . And, in many countries, calling emergency medical services allows listening basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way. Training is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance , or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee.

Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance , or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes. 1.Junior level certificate Basic Life Support 2.Senior level certificate 3.Special certificate Types of first aid which require training There are several types of first aid (and first aider) that require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken. Aquatic/Marine first aid is usually practiced by professionals such as lifeguards , professional mariners or in diver rescue , and covers the specific problems which may be faced after water-based rescue or delayed MedEvac . Battlefield first aid takes into account the specific needs of treating wounded combatants and non-combatants during armed conflict . Conflict First Aid focuses on support for stability and recovery of personal, social, group or system well-being and to address circumstantial safety needs. Hyperbaric first aid may be practiced by underwater diving professionals, who need to treat conditions such as decompression sickness . Oxygen first aid is the providing of oxygen to casualties with conditions resulting in hypoxia . It is also a standard first aid procedure for underwater diving incidents where gas bubble formation in the tissues is possible. Wilderness first aid is the provision of first aid under conditions where the arrival of emergency responders or the evacuation of an injured person may be delayed due to constraints of terrain, weather, and available persons or equipment. It may be necessary to care for an injured person for several hours or days. Mental health first aid is taught independently of physical first aid. How to support someone experiencing a mental health problem or in a crisis situation.

First aid services Some people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather. They may be designated as a first aider , or use some other title. This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross society and St. John Ambulance , [ 37 ] or as paid employment with a medical contractor. People performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed. Symbols Although commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the Red Cross . According to the Geneva Conventions and other international laws, the use of this and similar symbols is reserved for official agencies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent , and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution. The internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below. Some organizations may make use of the Star of Life , although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the Maltese Cross , like the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and St John Ambulance . Other symbols may also be used.

    "text": "A medical emergency is an acute injury or illness that poses an immediate risk to a person's life or long-term health, sometimes referred to as a situation risking \"life or limb\". These emergencies may require assistance from another, qualified person, as some of these emergencies, such as cardiovascular (heart), respiratory, and gastrointestinal cannot be dealt with by the victim themselves. [ 1 ] Dependent on the severity of the emergency, and the quality of any treatment given, it may require the involvement of multiple levels of care, from first aiders through emergency medical technicians , paramedics , emergency physicians and anesthesiologists . Any response to an emergency medical situation will depend strongly on the situation, the patient involved, and availability of resources to help them. It will also vary depending on whether the emergency occurs whilst in hospital under medical care, or outside medical care (for instance, in the street or alone at home). Response Summoning emergency services For emergencies starting outside medical care, a key component of providing proper care is to summon the emergency medical services (usually an ambulance ), by calling for help using the appropriate local emergency telephone number , such as 999 , 911 , 111 , 112 or 000 . After determining that the incident is a medical emergency (as opposed to, for example, a police call), the emergency dispatchers will generally run through a questioning system such as AMPDS in order to assess the priority level of the call, along with the caller's name and location. First aid and assisting emergency services Those who are trained to perform first aid can act within the bounds of the knowledge they have, whilst awaiting the next level of definitive care. Those who are not able to perform first aid can also assist by remaining calm and staying with the injured or ill person. A common complaint of emergency service personnel is the propensity of people to crowd around the scene of a victim, as it is generally unhelpful, making the patient more stressed, and obstructing the smooth working of the emergency services. If possible, first responders should designate a specific person to ensure that the emergency services are called. Another bystander should be sent to wait for their arrival and direct them to the proper location. Additional bystanders can be helpful in ensuring that crowds are moved away from the ill or injured patient, allowing the responder adequate space to work. Legal protections for responders To prevent the delay of life-saving aid from bystanders, many states of the USA have \" Good Samaritan laws \" which protect civilian",

Additional bystanders can be helpful in ensuring that crowds are moved away from the ill or injured patient, allowing the responder adequate space to work. Legal protections for responders To prevent the delay of life-saving aid from bystanders, many states of the USA have \" Good Samaritan laws \" which protect civilian responders who choose to assist in an emergency. In many situations, the general public may delay giving care due to fear of liability should they accidentally cause harm. Good Samaritan laws often protect responders who act within the scope of their knowledge and training, as a \"reasonable person\" in the same situation would act. The concept of implied consent can protect first responders in emergency situations. A first responder may not legally touch a patient without the patient's consent. However, consent may be either expressed or implied : [ 3 ] If a patient is able to make decisions, they must give expressed, informed consent before aid is given. However, if a patient is too injured or ill to make decisions – for example, if they are unconscious, have an altered mental status , or cannot communicate - implied consent applies. Implied consent means that treatment can be given, because it is assumed that the patient would want that care. Usually, once care has begun, a first responder or first aid provider may not leave the patient or terminate care until a responder of equal or higher training (such as an emergency medical technician ) assumes care. This can constitute abandonment of the patient and may subject the responder to legal liability. Care must be continued until the patient is transferred to a higher level of care; the situation becomes too unsafe to continue; or the responder is physically unable to continue due to exhaustion or hazards. Unless the situation is particularly hazardous and is likely to further endanger the patient, evacuating an injured victim requires special skills, and should be left to the professionals of the emergency medical and fire service. The chain of survival During a medical emergency in which a patient is no longer breathing and does not have a pulse , survival is predicated on adherence to the chain of survival , which has four components: Early access to emergency care Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Early defibrillation Early advanced life support (ALS) Clinical response Within hospital settings, an adequate staff is generally present to deal with",

Emergency medicine physicians and anaesthesiologists have training to deal with most medical emergencies, and maintain CPR and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certifications. In disasters or complex emergencies, most hospitals have protocols to summon on-site and off-site staff rapidly. Both emergency department and inpatient medical emergencies follow the basic protocol of Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Irrespective of the nature of the emergency, adequate blood pressure and oxygenation are required before the cause of the emergency can be eliminated. Possible exceptions include the clamping of arteries in severe hemorrhage . [ citation needed ] Non-trauma emergencies While the golden hour is a trauma treatment concept, two emergency medical conditions have well-documented time-critical treatment considerations: stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack). In the case of stroke, there is a window of three hours within which the benefit of thrombolytic drugs outweighs the risk of major bleeding. In the case of a heart attack, rapid stabilization of fatal arrhythmias can prevent sudden cardiac arrest. In addition, there is a direct relationship between time-to-treatment and the success of reperfusion (restoration of blood flow to the heart), including a time-dependent reduction in the mortality and morbidity .

    "text": "Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of traditional first aid to cover mental health conditions. Mental health first aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person experiencing or developing a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorders , or experiencing a mental health crisis situation such as suicidal ideation or panic attack . Mental health first aid training Mental health first aid training teaches members of the public how to help a person who is experiencing varying degrees of worsening mental health issues. [ 1 ] Like traditional first aid training, mental health first aid training does not teach people to treat or diagnose mental health or substance use conditions. [ 2 ] Instead, the training teaches people how to offer initial support until appropriate professional help is received or until the crisis resolves. [ 2 ] History The first mental health first aid training program was developed in Australia in 2001 by a research team led by Betty Kitchener and Anthony Jorm . [ 3 ] The program was created to teach members of the general public how to provide initial support to people experiencing mental health problems, as well as to connect them with appropriate professional help and community resources. [ 4 ] They tested the idea that giving first aid for mental health could lessen the effects of mental health problems, speed up recovery, and make suicide less likely by educating students on common mental health crises [ 1 ] including feelings of suicide, deliberate self-harm, panic attacks, or symptoms of psychosis, and how to deal with these situations. [ 1 ] [ 5 ] The idea was to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and make it more likely that people with mental health problems would seek help, which would reduce the risk of the person coming to harm. [ 1 ] Mental health first aid training programs are provided by different organizations around the world, many of them non-profit. They have been implemented in countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and a number of other European, Asian, and African countries. [ 6 ] Public reception General media articles and videos indicate that mental health first aid training has political and celebrity proponents, such as former US president Barack Obama , [ 7 ] former US first lady Michelle Obama , [ 8 ] and singer/actress Lady Gaga . [ 9 ] A few bills of law have been proposed by politicians in countries such as Australia [ 10 ] and the United Kingdom [ 11 ] to make mental health first aid training compulsory",

[ 9 ] A few bills of law have been proposed by politicians in countries such as Australia [ 10 ] and the United Kingdom [ 11 ] to make mental health first aid training compulsory in schools and other organizations. Although considered good practice in several countries, mental health first aid training is not legally imposed for organizations anywhere in the world. Curriculum The curriculum for mental health first aid training typically includes the following topics: Symptoms associated with common mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders, as well as a general overview of mental health and mental illnesses. [ 5 ] [ 2 ] Common warning signs of mental illnesses, such as mood, behavior, and cognitive changes. [ 5 ] Information about local counseling and psychiatric services, and how to help others gain access to them. [ 5 ] Using the knowledge from those topics, participants are trained on a step-by-step action plan for providing mental health first aid, including how to: [ 12 ] Evaluate the risk of suicide or harm Approach safely and appropriately Listen non-judgmentally Provide reassurance Encourage appropriate professional assistance Promote self-help Additional support strategies Depending on the program, there may be additional modules that target specific populations, such as children and adolescents, the elderly, or veterans. [ 13 ] or conditions such as substance use disorder and its related issues and challenges. [ 13 ] All of these topics are covered in order to develop participants' mental health literacy which consists of the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to recognize and respond appropriately to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. [ 13 ] Research on mental health first aid training A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been carried out to review data concerning the effectiveness of mental health first aid training on participants' knowledge of mental health conditions and subsequent helping behaviors. [ 2 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2014 concluded that mental health first aid training increases participants' knowledge of mental health, reduces their negative views, and increases their supportive behaviors toward people with mental health issues. [ 14 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2018 concluded that mental health first aid training enhances participants",

[ 2 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2014 concluded that mental health first aid training increases participants' knowledge of mental health, reduces their negative views, and increases their supportive behaviors toward people with mental health issues. [ 14 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2018 concluded that mental health first aid training enhances participants' knowledge, awareness, and beliefs about successful treatments for mental diseases. [ 15 ] At follow-up, there were slight improvements in the amount of assistance provided to a person with a mental health problem, but the nature of the change in the offered behaviors was unclear. [ 15 ] A systematic review conducted in 2020 showed that mental health first aid training had conflicting effects on how trainees applied the skills they learned, but no influence on how beneficial their actions were for the mental health of the recipients. [ 16 ] A systematic review conducted in 2020 focused on youth and adolescent mental health first aid training and found significant improvements in the understanding, recognition, stigmatizing perceptions, helping motivations, and helping behavior of youth and adolescent participants. [ 17 ] The most frequently stated improvement was in knowledge and confidence, while the least frequently reported improvement was in helping behavior. [ 17 ] As of 2024, the mental health first aid programme has been exported to over 25 countries and trained up over 6 million people worldwide, with over 1 million trained within Australia [ 18 ] [ 19 ] See also Emotional First Aid First responder , a specialist who is among the first to arrive and provide assistance at the scene of an emergency Mental disorder Mental health triage – A brief overview of the Australian concept for dealing with psychiatric emergencies, similar to regular triage Mobile Crisis , first responder service providing mental health evaluations, de-escalation, and referral to other services Police crisis intervention team , American movement of partnerships between law enforcement and mental health services Psychological first aid Public health , organized efforts to prevent disease, prolong life and promote health in a population Warning signs of suicide References and notes ^ a b c d Kitchener BA, Jorm AF (October 2002). \"Mental health first aid training for the public: evaluation of effects on knowledge, attitudes and helping behavior\" .

    "text": "Psychological first aid (PFA) is a technique designed to reduce the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder . It was developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) and National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (NC-PTSD), a section of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs , in 2006. It has been endorsed and used by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), the American Psychological Association (APA) and many others. It was developed in a two-day intensive collaboration, involving more than 25 disaster mental health researchers, an online survey of the first cohort that used PFA and repeated reviews of the draft. [ 1 ] Definition According to the NCTSN and NC-PTSD, psychological first aid is an evidence-informed modular approach for assisting people in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism to reduce initial distress and to foster short and long-term adaptive functioning. It was used by non-mental health experts, such as responders and volunteers. Other characteristics include non-intrusive pragmatic care and assessing needs. PFA does not necessarily involve discussion of the traumatic event and avoids any activity associated with \"debriefing\" as that technique has been associated with increased rates of PTSD. [ 2 ] Components Protecting from further harm Opportunity to talk without pressure Active listening Compassion Addressing and acknowledging concerns Discussing coping strategies Social support Offer to return to talk Referral Steps Contact and engagement Safety and comfort Stabilization Information gathering Practical assistance Connection with social supports Coping information Linkage with services History Before PFA, there was a procedure known as debriefing . Debriefing was a necessary step in a commercially available training intended to reduce PTSD called \"Critical Incident Stress Management\" (CISM) . It was intended to reduce the incidence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a major disaster. PTSD is now widely known to be debilitating; sufferers experience avoidance, flashbacks, hyper-vigilance, and numbness. Debriefing procedures were made a requirement after a disaster, with a desire to prevent people from developing PTSD. The idea behind it was to promote emotional processing by encouraging recollection of the event. Debriefing has origins with the military, where sessions were intended to boost morale and reduce distress after a mission, however the US Department of Defense discontinued the practice in 2002 due to evidence indicating that the practice increased PTSD rates.

Debriefing has origins with the military, where sessions were intended to boost morale and reduce distress after a mission, however the US Department of Defense discontinued the practice in 2002 due to evidence indicating that the practice increased PTSD rates. [ 3 ] Debriefing was done in a single session with seven stages: introduction, facts, thoughts and impressions, emotional reactions, normalization, planning for future, and disengagement. [ 2 ] Debriefing was found to be at best, ineffective, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and at worst, harmful [ 8 ] with some studies finding that PTSD rates actually increased as a result of debriefing. [ 2 ] There are several theories as to why debriefing increased incidence of PTSD. First, those who were likely to develop PTSD were not helped by a single session. Second, being re-exposed too soon to the trauma could lead to retraumatization. Exposure therapy in cognitive behavioral therapy allows the person to adjust to the stimuli before slowly increasing severity. Debriefing did not allow for this. Also, normal distress was seen to be pathological after a debriefing and those who had been through a trauma thought they had a mental disorder because they were upset. Debriefing assumes that everyone reacts the same way to a trauma, and anyone who deviates from that path, is pathological. But there are many ways to cope with a trauma, especially so soon after it happens. [ 9 ] [ 2 ] Effectiveness PFA seems to address many of the issues in debriefing. It is not compulsory and can be done in multiple sessions and links those who need more help to services. It deals with practical issues which are often more pressing and create stress. It also improves self-efficacy by letting people cope their own way. PFA has attempted to be culturally sensitive , but whether it is or not has not been shown. However, a drawback is the lack of empirical evidence . [ 10 ] While it is based on research, it is not proven by research.

    "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) [ b ] is a mental disorder that develops from experiencing a traumatic event, such as sexual assault , domestic violence , child abuse , warfare and its associated traumas, natural disaster, bereavement, traffic collision , or other threats on a person's life or well-being. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma -related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in the way a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 9 ] These symptoms last for more than a month after the event and can include triggers such as misophonia . [ 1 ] Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play . [ 10 ] [ 1 ] Most people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD. [ 2 ] People who experience interpersonal violence such as rape, other sexual assaults, being kidnapped, stalking, physical abuse by an intimate partner, and childhood abuse are more likely to develop PTSD than those who experience non- assault based trauma, such as accidents and natural disasters . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Prevention may be possible when counselling is targeted at those with early symptoms, but is not effective when provided to all trauma-exposed individuals regardless of whether symptoms are present. [ 2 ] The main treatments for people with PTSD are counselling (psychotherapy) and medication. [ 4 ] [ 14 ] Most combination therapy (psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy) does not seem to be more effective than psychotherapy alone, [ 2 ] [ 15 ] except for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . [ 16 ] Benefits from medication are less than those seen with counselling. [ 2 ] Antidepressants of the SSRI or SNRI type are the first-line medications used for PTSD and are moderately beneficial for about half of people. [ 5 ] Medications, other than some SSRIs or SNRIs, do not have enough evidence to support their use and, in the case of benzodiazepines , may worsen outcomes.

[ 1 ] In much of the rest of the world, rates during a given year are between 0.5% and 1%. [ 1 ] Higher rates may occur in regions of armed conflict . [ 2 ] It is more common in women than men. [ 19 ] Symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders have been documented since at least the time of the ancient Greeks . [ 20 ] A few instances of evidence of post-traumatic illness have been argued to exist from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as the diary of Samuel Pepys , who described intrusive and distressing symptoms following the 1666 Fire of London . [ 21 ] During the world wars , the condition was known under various terms, including \" shell shock \", \"war nerves\", neurasthenia and ' combat neurosis '. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The term \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" came into use in the 1970s, in large part due to the diagnoses of U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War . [ 24 ] It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). [ 25 ] Signs and symptoms Symptoms of PTSD generally begin within the first three months after the inciting traumatic event, but may not begin until years later. [ 26 ] [ 4 ] In the typical case, the individual with PTSD persistently avoids either trauma-related thoughts and emotions or discussion of the traumatic event and may even have amnesia of the event ( dissociative amnesia ).

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] While it is common to have symptoms after any traumatic event, these must persist to a sufficient degree (i.e., causing dysfunction in life or clinical levels of distress) for longer than one month after the trauma to be classified as PTSD (clinically significant dysfunction or distress for less than one month after the trauma may be acute stress disorder ). [ 1 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Some following a traumatic event experience post-traumatic growth . [ 33 ] Trauma victims social interactions, with significant others, have been shown to influence PTSD symptoms. Countersupportive interactions include criticism, making the victim feel guilty, or telling them they are crazy. [ 34 ] Associated medical conditions Trauma survivors often develop depression, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders in addition to PTSD. [ 35 ] More than 50% of those with PTSD have co-morbid anxiety , mood , or substance use disorders . [ 36 ] Substance use disorder , such as alcohol use disorder , commonly co-occur with PTSD. [ 37 ] Recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder or other anxiety disorders may be hindered, or the condition worsened, when substance use disorders are comorbid with PTSD. Resolving these problems can bring about improvement in an individual's mental health status and anxiety levels. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] PTSD has a strong association with tinnitus , [ 40 ] and speculation exists that PTSD may cause some tinnitus seen in association with the condition. [ 41 ] PTSD is also associated with several physical health comorbidities that involve inflammatory processes and immune system dysregulation.

Moral injury is associated with shame and guilt, while PTSD is associated with anxiety and fear. [ 44 ] : 2,8,11 Risk factors Persons considered at risk for developing PTSD include combat military personnel, survivors of natural disasters, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of violent crime. Persons employed in occupations that expose them to violence (such as soldiers) or disasters (such as emergency service workers) are also at risk. [ 46 ] Other occupations at an increased risk include police officers, firefighters, [ 47 ] first responders, ambulance personnel, health care professionals, train drivers, divers, journalists, and sailors, as well as people who work at banks, post offices, or in stores. [ 48 ] The intensity of the traumatic event is also associated with a subsequent risk of developing PTSD, with experiences related to witnessed death, or witnessed or experienced torture, injury, bodily disfigurement, traumatic brain injury being highly associated with the development of PTSD. Similarly, experiences that are unexpected or in which the victim cannot escape are also associated with a high risk of developing PTSD. [ 36 ] Trauma PTSD has been associated with a wide range of traumatic events. The risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event varies by trauma type [ 49 ] [ 50 ] and is the highest following exposure to sexual violence (11.4%), particularly rape (19.0%). [ 51 ] Men are more likely to experience a traumatic event (of any type), but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault . [ 52 ] Motor vehicle collision survivors, both children and adults, are at an increased risk of PTSD.

[ 51 ] Risk of PTSD almost doubles to 4.6% for life-threatening auto accidents. [ 51 ] Females were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD following a road traffic accident , whether the accident occurred during childhood or adulthood. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Post-traumatic stress reactions have been studied in children and adolescents. [ 55 ] The rate of PTSD might be lower in children than adults, but in the absence of therapy, symptoms may continue for decades. [ 56 ] One estimate suggests that the proportion of children and adolescents having PTSD in a non-wartorn population in a developed country may be 1% compared to 1.5% to 3% of adults. [ 56 ] On average, 16% of children exposed to a traumatic event develop PTSD, with the incidence varying according to the type of exposure and gender. [ 57 ] Similar to the adult population, risk factors for PTSD in children include: female gender , exposure to disasters, maladaptive coping behaviors , [ 58 ] or lacking proper social support systems. [ 59 ] Predictor models have consistently found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, neurobiological differences, and familial stressors are associated with risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] It has been difficult to find consistently predictive aspects of the events that predict, but peritraumatic dissociation has been a fairly consistent predictive indicator of the development of PTSD.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Women who experience physical violence are more likely to develop PTSD than men. [ 66 ] An individual that has been exposed to domestic violence is predisposed to the development of PTSD. There is a strong association between the development of PTSD in mothers who experienced domestic violence during the perinatal period of their pregnancy. [ 68 ] Those who have experienced sexual assault or rape may develop symptoms of PTSD. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] The likelihood of sustained symptoms of PTSD is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew. The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor. [ 71 ] Military service in combat is a risk factor for developing PTSD. [ 36 ] Around 22% of people exposed to combat develop PTSD; in about 25% of military personnel who develop PTSD, its appearance is delayed. [ 36 ] Refugees are also at an increased risk for PTSD due to their exposure to war, hardships, and traumatic events. The rates for PTSD within refugee populations range from 4% to 86%. [ 72 ] While the stresses of war affect everyone involved, displaced persons are more so than others. [ 73 ] Challenges related to the overall psychosocial well-being of refugees are complex and individually nuanced. Refugees have reduced levels of well-being and a high rate of mental distress due to past and ongoing trauma. Groups that are particularly affected and whose needs often remain unmet are women, older people, and unaccompanied minors.

[ 51 ] [ 75 ] However, the majority of people who experience this type of event will not develop PTSD. An analysis from the WHO World Mental Health Surveys found a 5.2% risk of developing PTSD after learning of the unexpected death of a loved one. [ 75 ] Because of the high prevalence of this type of traumatic event, the unexpected death of a loved one accounts for approximately 20% of PTSD cases worldwide. [ 51 ] Medical conditions associated with an increased risk of PTSD include cancer, [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] heart attack, [ 79 ] and stroke. [ 80 ] 22% of cancer survivors present with lifelong PTSD like symptoms. [ 81 ] Intensive-care unit (ICU) hospitalization is also a risk factor for PTSD. [ 82 ] Some women experience PTSD from their experiences related to breast cancer and mastectomy . [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 76 ] Loved ones of those who experience life-threatening illnesses are also at risk for developing PTSD, such as parents of a child with chronic illnesses. [ 85 ] Research exists that demonstrates that survivors of psychotic episodes , which exist in diseases such as schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar I disorder , and others, are at greater risk of developing PTSD. This is often due to the experiences one may have during and after psychosis. Such traumatic experiences include, but are not limited to, experiences in psychiatric hospitals , police interactions, social stigma, and embarrassment due to psychotic behavior, suicidal behavior and attempts, distressing delusions and hallucinations, and the fear of losing control or actual loss of control.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Both PTSD and PTSS have been associated with increased distress and impaired quality of life, [ 92 ] and have been reported in newly diagnosed patients as well as in long‐term survivors. [ 93 ] The PTSD Field Trials for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), revealed that 22% of cancer survivors present with lifetime cancer-related PTSD (CR-PTSD), endorsing cancer diagnosis and treatment as a traumatic stressor. [ 94 ] Therefore, as the number of people diagnosed with cancer increases and cancer survivorship improves, cancer-related PTSD becomes a more prominent issue, so providing for cancer patients' physical and psychological needs becomes increasingly important. [ 95 ] Women who experience miscarriage are at risk of PTSD. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Those who experience subsequent miscarriages have an increased risk of PTSD compared to those experiencing only one. [ 96 ] PTSD can also occur after childbirth and the risk increases if a woman has experienced trauma before the pregnancy. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (that is, excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8 and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum, [ 101 ] with rates dropping to 1.5% at six months postpartum.

[ 105 ] A literature review of studies examining PTSD following disasters between 1980 and 2007 found that the prevalence of PTSD after natural disasters was lower than the prevalence of the condition after man-made disasters. This review found prevalence rates between 3.7% to 60%. Research has shown that PTSD impacts approximately one in four earthquake survivors (23.66 %). [ 106 ] Determinants of the risk of PTSD developing after disaster include the extent of physical injury, risk of life, and number of fatalities. [ 107 ] Geographical proximity to the epicenter of a natural disaster has been shown to contribute to people developing PTSD. [ 108 ] Natural disasters can displace families and challenge people’s sense of control and security. [ 109 ] Mental health recovery of individuals, communities and countries after emergencies, including natural disasters, is important for social and economic reasons. Mental health emergency preparedness and response need to be effective after natural disasters. [ 110 ] Genetics There is evidence that susceptibility to PTSD is hereditary . Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused by genetics alone. [ 63 ] For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin's having PTSD compared to dizygotic twins (non-identical twins). [ 111 ] Women with a smaller hippocampus might be more likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic event based on preliminary findings. [ 112 ] Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized anxiety disorders, and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and drug dependence share greater than 40% genetic similarities.

The researchers in her study focused on a stress gene called FKBP5 that is linked to PTSD. The results of this study underscore the genetic components of PTSD as they showed an effect on methylation of the FKBP5 gene both in the parents who experienced trauma in concentration camps, as well as their offspring. [ 113 ] Evolutionary Evolutionary Psychiatry and Evolutionary Psychology perspectives interpret PTSD symptoms as extreme or dysregulated forms of defensive responses that were advantageous in ancestral contexts. [ 114 ] Hypervigilance, intrusive memories, and exaggerated startle responses may reflect overactivation of mechanisms designed to promote survival after trauma. [ 115 ] While these accounts can help contextualize symptom clusters, reviews emphasize that they remain theoretical and require integration with neurobiological and psychosocial research. Pathophysiology Neuroendocrinology PTSD symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an overreactive adrenaline response, which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain. These patterns can persist long after the event that triggered the fear, making an individual hyper-responsive to future fearful situations. [ 30 ] [ 116 ] During traumatic experiences, the high levels of stress hormones secreted suppress hypothalamic activity that may be a major factor toward the development of PTSD. [ 117 ] PTSD causes biochemical changes in the brain and body that differ from other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression . Individuals diagnosed with PTSD respond more strongly to a dexamethasone suppression test than individuals diagnosed with clinical depression . [ 118 ] [ 119 ] Most people with PTSD show a low secretion of cortisol and high secretion of catecholamines in urine , [ 120 ] with a norepinephrine /cortisol ratio consequently higher than comparable non-diagnosed individuals. [ 121 ] This is in contrast to the normative fight-or-flight response , in which both catecholamine and cortisol levels are elevated after exposure to a stressor.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] Together, these findings suggest abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis . The maintenance of fear has been shown to include the HPA axis, the locus coeruleus - noradrenergic systems, and the connections between the limbic system and frontal cortex . The HPA axis that coordinates the hormonal response to stress, [ 126 ] which activates the LC-noradrenergic system, is implicated in the over-consolidation of memories that occurs in the aftermath of trauma. [ 127 ] This over-consolidation increases the likelihood of one's developing PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for threat detection and the conditioned and unconditioned fear responses that are carried out as a response to a threat. [ 63 ] The HPA axis is responsible for coordinating the hormonal response to stress. [ 63 ] Given the strong cortisol suppression to dexamethasone in PTSD, HPA axis abnormalities are likely predicated on strong negative feedback inhibition of cortisol, itself due to an increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors . [ 128 ] PTSD has been hypothesized to be a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and hyperresponsive HPA axis. [ 129 ] Low cortisol levels may predispose individuals to PTSD: Following war trauma, Swedish soldiers serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina with low pre-service salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with PTSD symptoms, following war trauma, than soldiers with normal pre-service levels. [ 130 ] Because cortisol is normally important in restoring homeostasis after the stress response, it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is, longer and more distressing—response, setting the stage for PTSD. It is thought that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system mediates the over-consolidation of fear memory. High levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity, and because people with PTSD",

It is thought that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system mediates the over-consolidation of fear memory. High levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity, and because people with PTSD tend to have reduced levels of cortisol, it has been proposed that individuals with PTSD cannot regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress. [ 117 ] Intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses are thought to be a result of the response to associated triggers. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been reported to reduce the release of norepinephrine and has been demonstrated to have anxiolytic properties in animal models. Studies have shown that people with PTSD demonstrate reduced levels of NPY, possibly indicating their increased anxiety levels. [ 63 ] Other studies indicate that people with PTSD have chronically low levels of serotonin , which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity. [ 131 ] Serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid production. Dopamine levels in a person with PTSD can contribute to symptoms: low levels can contribute to anhedonia , apathy , impaired attention , and motor deficits; high levels can contribute to psychosis , agitation , and restlessness. [ 131 ] Studies have also described elevated concentrations of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine in PTSD. [ 132 ] This kind of type 2 allostatic adaptation may contribute to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and other stress mediators. Hyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can also be caused by continued exposure to high stress. Overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with PTSD. A decrease in other norepinephrine functions (awareness of the current environment) prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing the experience, and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environment.

[ 131 ] There is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of PTSD. A 2012 review showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and PTSD. The majority of reports indicate people with PTSD have elevated levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone , lower basal cortisol levels, and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the HPA axis by dexamethasone . [ 63 ] [ 133 ] Neuroimmunology Studies on the peripheral immune have found dysfunction with elevated cytokine levels and a higher risk of immune-related chronic diseases among individuals with PTSD. [ 134 ] Neuroimmune dysfunction has also been found in PTSD, raising the possibility of a suppressed central immune response due to reduced activity of microglia in the brain in response to immune challenges. Individuals with PTSD, compared to controls, have a lower increase in a marker of microglial activation ( 18-kDa translocator protein ) following lipopolysaccharide administration. [ 135 ] This neuroimmune suppression is also associated with greater severity of anhedonic symptoms. Researchers suggest that treatments aimed at restoring neuroimmune function could be beneficial for alleviating PTSD symptoms. [ 135 ] Neuroanatomy A meta-analysis of structural MRI studies found an association with reduced total brain volume, intracranial volume, and volumes of the hippocampus , insula cortex , and anterior cingulate . [ 137 ] Much of this research stems from PTSD in those exposed to the Vietnam War. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] People with PTSD have decreased brain activity in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , areas linked to the experience and regulation of emotion. [ 140 ] The amygdala is strongly involved in forming emotional memories, especially fear-related memories.

According to one theory, this suppression may be the cause of the flashbacks that can affect people with PTSD. When someone with PTSD undergoes stimuli similar to the traumatic event, the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the person's memory. [ 63 ] [ 141 ] The amygdalocentric model of PTSD proposes that the amygdala is very much aroused and insufficiently controlled by the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, in particular during extinction . [ 142 ] This is consistent with an interpretation of PTSD as a syndrome of deficient extinction ability. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The basolateral nucleus (BLA) of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli, which results in the fear conditioning present in PTSD. The BLA activates the central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala, which elaborates the fear response (including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response). Descending inhibitory inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulate the transmission from the BLA to the CeA, which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses. [ 63 ] While as a whole, amygdala hyperactivity is reported by meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging in PTSD, there is a large degree of heterogeneity, more so than in social anxiety disorder or phobic disorder. Comparing dorsal (roughly the CeA) and ventral (roughly the BLA) clusters, hyperactivity is more robust in the ventral cluster, while hypoactivity is evident in the dorsal cluster. The distinction may explain the blunted emotions in PTSD (via desensitization in the CeA) as well as the fear-related component. [ 144 ] In a 2007 study, Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans who did not have such symptoms.

[ 145 ] This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). [ 146 ] Evidence suggests that endogenous cannabinoid levels are reduced in PTSD, particularly anandamide , and that cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are increased to compensate. [ 147 ] There appears to be a link between increased CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala and abnormal threat processing and hyperarousal, but not dysphoria, in trauma survivors. A 2020 study found no evidence for conclusions from prior research that suggested low IQ is a risk factor for developing PTSD. [ 148 ] Diagnosis NICE recommends clinicians familiarise themselves with the range of symptoms associated with functional impairment and events that are known to contribute to the development of PTSD. It is advised to ask specific questions when assessing and to consider the frequency of traumatic events experienced. Assessment should be comprehensive, including an assessment of physical, psychological, and social needs and a risk assessment. [ 149 ] PTSD can be difficult to diagnose because of: the subjective nature of most of the diagnostic criteria (although this is true for many mental disorders); the potential for over-reporting , e.g., while seeking disability benefits, or when PTSD could be a mitigating factor at criminal sentencing [ 150 ] the potential for under-reporting, e.g., stigma, pride, fear that a PTSD diagnosis might preclude certain employment opportunities; symptom overlap with other mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; [ 151 ] association with other mental disorders such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; substance use disorders, which often produce some of the same signs and symptoms as PTSD; and substance use disorders can increase vulnerability to PTSD or exacerbate PTSD symptoms or both; and PTSD increases the risk of developing substance use disorders.

[ 156 ] The 17 item PTSD checklist is also capable of monitoring the severity of symptoms and the response to treatment. [ 36 ] There are also several screening and assessment instruments for use with children and adolescents. These include the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire, [ 159 ] [ 160 ] and UCLA Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for DSM-IV . [ 161 ] [ 162 ] In addition, there are also screening and assessment instruments for caregivers of very young children (six years of age and younger). These include the Young Child PTSD Screen, [ 163 ] the Young Child PTSD Checklist, [ 163 ] and the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment.

[ 1 ] The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD include four symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision ( ICD-10 ) classifies PTSD (code F43.1 ) under \"Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders\". [ 173 ] The ICD-10 criteria for PTSD include re-experiencing, avoidance, and either increased reactivity or inability to recall certain details related to the event. [ 173 ] The ICD-11 diagnostic description for PTSD (code 6B40 ) contains three components or symptom groups (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, and (3) heightened sense of threat. [ 174 ] [ 175 ] ICD-11 no longer includes verbal thoughts about the traumatic event as a symptom. [ 175 ] There is a predicted lower rate of diagnosed PTSD using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10 or DSM-5. [ 175 ] ICD-11 also proposes identifying a distinct subgroup with Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD; code 6B41 ), who have more often experienced several or sustained traumas and have greater functional impairment than those with PTSD. [ 175 ] Differential diagnosis A diagnosis of PTSD requires that the person has been exposed to an extreme stressor. Any stressor can result in a diagnosis of adjustment disorder , and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for PTSD. The symptom pattern for acute stress disorder must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma.

If it lasts longer, and the symptom pattern fits the characteristics of PTSD, the diagnosis may be changed. [ 28 ] Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) may be diagnosed for intrusive thoughts that are recurring but not related to a specific traumatic event. [ 28 ] In extreme cases of prolonged, repeated traumatization where there is no viable chance of escape, survivors may develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder . [ 176 ] This occurs as a result of layers of trauma rather than a single traumatic event, and includes additional symptomatology, such as the loss of a coherent sense of self. [ 177 ] Prevention Modest benefits have been seen from early access to cognitive behavioral therapy . Critical incident stress management has been suggested as a means of preventing PTSD, but subsequent studies suggest it may produce negative outcomes. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] A 2019 Cochrane review did not find evidence to support the use of intervention and that \"multiple session interventions may result in worse outcomes than no intervention, for some individuals.\" [ 180 ] The World Health Organization recommends against the use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants for acute stress (symptoms lasting less than one month). [ 181 ] Some evidence supports the use of hydrocortisone for prevention in adults, although there is limited or no evidence supporting propranolol , escitalopram , temazepam , or gabapentin . [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Psychological debriefing Trauma-exposed individuals often receive treatment called psychological debriefing in an effort to prevent PTSD, which consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event. [ 184 ] However, several meta-analyses found that psychological debriefing is unhelpful, is potentially harmful and does not reduce the future risk of developing PTSD.

[ 187 ] Early intervention Trauma-focused intervention delivered within days or weeks of the potentially traumatic event has been found to decrease PTSD symptoms. [ 188 ] Similar to psychological debriefing, the goal of early intervention is to lessen the intensity and frequency of stress symptoms, to prevent new-onset or relapsed mental disorders and further distress later in the healing process. [ 189 ] Risk-targeted interventions Risk-targeted interventions are those that attempt to mitigate specific formative information or events. It can target modeling normal behaviors, instruction on a task, or giving information on the event.

[ 200 ] A meta-analysis in children and adolescents also found that EMDR was as efficacious as CBT. [ 201 ] Children with PTSD are far more likely to pursue treatment at school (because of its proximity and ease) than at a free clinic. [ 202 ] CBT seeks to change the way a person feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior, or both, responsible for negative emotions. Results from a 2018 systematic review found high strength of evidence that supports CBT-exposure therapy efficacious for a reduction in PTSD and depression symptoms, as well as the loss of PTSD diagnosis. [ 9 ] CBT has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD and is currently considered the standard of care for PTSD by the United States Department of Defense . [ 203 ] [ 204 ] In CBT, individuals learn to identify thoughts that make them feel afraid or upset and replace them with less distressing thoughts. The goal is to understand how certain thoughts about events cause PTSD-related stress.

[ 211 ] [ 36 ] Some organizations [ which? ] have endorsed the need for exposure. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been actively training mental health treatment staff in prolonged exposure therapy [ 214 ] and cognitive processing therapy [ 215 ] in an effort to better treat U.S. veterans with PTSD. Recent research on contextually based third-generation behavior therapies suggests that they may produce results comparable to some of the better validated therapies. [ 216 ] Many of these therapy methods have a significant element of exposure [ 217 ] and have demonstrated success in treating the primary problems of PTSD and co-occurring depressive symptoms. [ 218 ] Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed and studied by Francine Shapiro . [ 219 ] She had noticed that, when she was thinking about disturbing memories herself, her eyes were moving rapidly. When she brought her eye movements under control while thinking, the thoughts were less distressing. [ 219 ] In 2002, Shapiro and Maxfield published a theory of why this might work, called adaptive information processing. [ 220 ] This theory proposes that eye movement can be used to facilitate emotional processing of memories, changing the person's memory to attend to more adaptive information. [ 221 ] The therapist initiates voluntary rapid eye movements while the person focuses on memories, feelings or thoughts about a particular trauma. [ 56 ] [ 222 ] The therapist uses hand movements to get the person to move their eyes backward and forward, but hand-tapping or tones can also be used.

[ 223 ] Several scientific studies have evaluated the efficacy of EMDR in adults [ 224 ] as well as children and adolescents. [ 222 ] There is moderate strength of evidence to support the efficacy of EMDR \"for reduction in PTSD symptoms, loss of diagnosis, and reduction in depressive symptoms\" according to a 2018 systematic review update. [ 9 ] In children and adolescents, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as CBT, and superior to waitlist or placebo. [ 201 ] There was some evidence that EMDR might prevent depression. [ 224 ] Adverse effects were largely unstudied. [ 224 ] The benefits were greater for women with a history of sexual assault compared with people who had experienced other types of traumatizing events (such as accidents, physical assaults, and war). The eye movement component of the therapy may not be critical for benefit. [ 56 ] [ 221 ] Other approaches, in particular involving social supports, [ 225 ] [ 226 ] may also be important.

[ 228 ] [ 5 ] The SSRIs paroxetine and sertraline are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of PTSD . [ 36 ] Benzodiazepines are not recommended for the treatment of PTSD due to a lack of evidence of benefit and risk of worsening PTSD symptoms. [ 232 ] Some authors believe that the use of benzodiazepines is contraindicated for acute stress, as this group of drugs can cause dissociation .

[ 5 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] Prazosin , an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been used in veterans with PTSD to reduce nightmares. Studies show variability in symptom improvement, appropriate dosages, and efficacy in this population.

[ 243 ] [ 244 ] [ c ] However, use of cannabis or derived products is widespread among U.S. veterans with PTSD. [ 245 ] The cannabinoid nabilone is sometimes used for nightmares in PTSD.

[ 264 ] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 830,000 Vietnam War veterans had symptoms of PTSD. [ 265 ] The National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study (NVVRS) found 15% of male and 9% of female Vietnam veterans had PTSD at the time of the study. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 31% for males and 27% for females. In a reanalysis of the NVVRS data, along with analysis of the data from the Matsunaga Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde found that, contrary to the initial analysis of the NVVRS data, a large majority of Vietnam veterans had PTSD symptoms (but not the disorder itself). Four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed 20–25 years after Vietnam. [ 266 ] A 2011 study from Georgia State University and San Diego State University found that rates of PTSD diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones, had tours of longer than a year, experienced combat, or were injured. Military personnel serving in combat zones were 12.1 percentage points more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis than their active-duty counterparts in non-combat zones. Those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone were 14.3 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those who had served less than one year. [ 267 ] Experiencing an enemy firefight was associated with an 18.3 percentage point increase in the probability of PTSD, while being wounded or injured in combat was associated with a 23.9 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis.

For the 2.16 million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones between 2001 and 2010, the total estimated two-year costs of treatment for combat-related PTSD are between $1.54 billion and $2.69 billion. [ 267 ] As of 2013, rates of PTSD have been estimated at up to 20% for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. [ 268 ] As of 2013 13% of veterans returning from Iraq were unemployed . [ 269 ] The September 11 attacks took the lives of nearly 3,000 people, leaving 6,000 injured. [ 270 ] First responders ( police , firefighters , and emergency medical technicians ), sanitation workers, and volunteers were all involved in the recovery efforts. The prevalence of probable PTSD in these highly exposed populations was estimated across several studies using in-person, telephone, and online interviews and questionnaires . [ 270 ] [ 271 ] [ 272 ] Overall prevalence of PTSD was highest immediately following the attacks and decreased over time. However, disparities were found among the different types of recovery workers. [ 270 ] [ 271 ] The rate of probable PTSD for first responders was lowest directly after the attacks and increased from ranges of 4.8–7.8% to 7.4–16.5% between the 5–6 year follow-up and a later assessment.

[ 270 ] [ 271 ] Additional research has been performed to understand the social consequences of the September 11 attacks. Alcohol consumption was assessed in a cohort of World Trade Center workers using the cut-annoyed-guilty-eye (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder . Almost 50% of World Trade Center workers who self-identified as alcohol users reported drinking more during the rescue efforts. [ 272 ] Nearly a quarter of these individuals reported drinking more following the recovery. [ 272 ] If determined to have probable PTSD status, the risk of developing an alcohol problem was double compared to those without psychological morbidity . [ 272 ] Social disability was also studied in this cohort as a social consequence of the September 11 attacks. Defined by the disruption of family, work, and social life, the risk of developing social disability increased 17-fold when categorized as having probable PTSD. [ 272 ] Anthropology Cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally. [ 273 ] Trauma (and resulting PTSD) is often experienced through the outermost limits of suffering, pain, and fear. The images and experiences relived through PTSD often defy easy description through language. Therefore, the translation of these experiences from one language to another is problematic, and the primarily Euro-American research on trauma is necessarily limited. [ 274 ] The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that people perceive the world differently according to the language they speak: language and the world it exists within reflect on the perceptions of the speaker. [ 275 ] For example, ethnopsychology studies in Nepal have found that cultural idioms and concepts related to trauma often do not translate to western terminologies: piDaa is a term that may align to trauma/suffering, but also people who suffer from piDaa are considered paagal (mad) and are subject to negative social stigma, indicating the need for culturally appropriate and carefully tailored support interventions.

[ 276 ] More generally, different cultures remember traumatic experiences within different linguistic and cultural paradigms. As such, cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), [ needs update ] and constructed through the Euro-American paradigm of psychology. [ 273 ] There remains a dearth of studies into the conceptual frameworks that surround trauma in non-Western cultures. [ 273 ] There is little evidence to suggest therapeutic benefit in synthesizing local idioms of distress into a culturally constructed disorder of the post-Vietnam era, a practice anthropologist believe contributes to category fallacy. [ clarification needed ] [ 273 ] For many cultures, there is no single linguistic corollary to PTSD, psychological trauma being a multi-faceted concept with corresponding variances of expression. [ 276 ] Designating the effects of trauma as an affliction of the spirit is common in many non-Western cultures, where idioms such as \"soul loss\" and \"weak heart\" indicate a preference to confer suffering to a spirit-body or heart-body diametric. These idioms reflect the emphasis that collectivist cultures place on healing trauma through familial, cultural, and religious activities while avoiding the stigma that accompanies a mind-body approach. [ 273 ] Prescribing PTSD diagnostics within these communities is ineffective and often detrimental. [ citation needed ] For trauma that extends beyond the individual, such as the effects of war, anthropologists believe applying the term \"social suffering\" or \" cultural bereavement \" to be more beneficial. [ 277 ] Every facet of society is affected by conflict; the prolonged exposure to mass violence can lead to a 'continuous suffering' among civilians, soldiers, and bordering countries.

[ 279 ] Though the DSM gets reviewed and updated regularly, it is unable to fully encompass the disorder due to its Americanization (or Westernization). [ 280 ] That is, what may be considered characteristics of PTSD in Western society may not directly translate across to other cultures around the world. Displaced people of the African country Burundi experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety, though a few symptoms specific to PTSD were noted. [ 281 ] In a similar review, Sudanese refugees relocated in Uganda were 'concerned with material [effects]' (lack of food, shelter, and healthcare), rather than psychological distress. [ 281 ] In this case, many refugees did not present symptoms at all, with a minor few developing anxiety and depression. [ 281 ] War-related stresses and traumas will be ingrained in the individual, [ 278 ] however, they will be affected differently from culture to culture, and the \"clear-cut\" rubric for diagnosing PTSD does not allow for culturally contextual reactions to take place.

[ 292 ] History Aspects of PTSD in soldiers of ancient Assyria have been identified using written sources from 1300 to 600 BCE. These Assyrian soldiers would undergo a three-year rotation of combat before being allowed to return home, and were reported to have faced immense challenges in reconciling their past actions in war with their civilian lives. [ 293 ] Connections between the actions of Viking berserkers and the hyperarousal of post-traumatic stress disorder have also been drawn. [ 294 ] Psychiatrist Jonathan Shay has proposed that Lady Percy 's soliloquy in the William Shakespeare play Henry IV, Part 1 (act 2, scene 3, lines 40–62 [ 295 ] ), written around 1597, represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of PTSD. [ 296 ] Many historical wartime diagnoses such as railway spine , stress syndrome, nostalgia , soldier's heart, shell shock , battle fatigue , combat stress reaction , and traumatic war neurosis are now associated with PTSD. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The correlations between combat and PTSD are undeniable; according to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and, after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\" [ 299 ] The DSM-I (1952) includes a diagnosis of \"gross stress reaction\", which has similarities to the modern definition and understanding of PTSD. [ 300 ] Gross stress reaction is defined as a normal personality using established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress.

[ 301 ] The diagnosis includes language which relates the condition to combat as well as to \"civilian catastrophe\". [ 301 ] The addition of the term to the DSM-III was greatly influenced by the experiences and conditions of U.S. [ 302 ] In fact, much of the available published research regarding PTSD is based on studies done on veterans of the war in Vietnam. Because of the initial overt focus on PTSD as a combat related disorder when it was first fleshed out in the years following the war in Vietnam, in 1975 Ann Wolbert Burgess and Lynda Lytle Holmstrom defined rape trauma syndrome (RTS) to draw attention to the striking similarities between the experiences of soldiers returning from war and of rape victims. [ 303 ] This paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of PTSD. Early in 1978, the diagnosis term \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" was first recommended in a working group finding presented to the Committee of Reactive Disorders. [ 304 ] A USAF study carried out in 1979 focused on individuals (civilian and military) who had worked to recover or identify the remains of those who died in Jonestown . The bodies had been dead for several days, and a third of them had been children. The study used the term \"dysphoria\" to describe PTSD-like symptoms. [ 305 ] After PTSD became an official American psychiatric diagnosis with the publication of DSM-III (1980), the number of personal injury lawsuits ( tort claims) asserting the plaintiff had PTSD increased rapidly. However, triers of fact (judges and juries) often regarded the PTSD diagnostic criteria as imprecise, a view shared by legal scholars, trauma specialists, forensic psychologists , and forensic psychiatrists . The condition was termed \"posttraumatic stress disorder\" in the DSM-III (1980).

[ 306 ] The DSM-IV classified PTSD under anxiety disorders. In the ICD-10 (first used in 1994), the spelling of the condition was \"post-traumatic stress disorder\". [ 307 ] In 2012, the researchers from the Grady Trauma Project highlighted the tendency people have to focus on the combat side of PTSD: \"less public awareness has focused on civilian PTSD, which results from trauma exposure that is not combat related...\" and \"much of the research on civilian PTSD has focused on the sequelae of a single, disastrous event, such as the Oklahoma City bombing , September 11th attacks , and Hurricane Katrina \". [ 308 ] Disparity in the focus of PTSD research affected the already popular perception of the exclusive interconnectedness of combat and PTSD. This is misleading when it comes to understanding the implications and extent of PTSD as a neurological disorder. The DSM-5 (2013) created a new category called \"trauma and stressor-related disorders\", in which PTSD is now classified. [ 1 ] America's 2014 National Comorbidity Survey reports that \"the traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women.\" [ 66 ] Terminology The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not hyphenate \"post\" and \"traumatic\", thus, the DSM-5 lists the disorder as posttraumatic stress disorder . [ 309 ] However, many scientific journal articles and other scholarly publications do hyphenate the name of the disorder, viz. , \"post-traumatic stress disorder\". [ 310 ] Dictionaries also differ concerning the preferred spelling of the disorder with the Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged using the hyphenated spelling, and the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition and the Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary giving the non-hyphenated spelling.

[ 311 ] Some authors have used the terms \" post-traumatic stress syndrome \" or \" post-traumatic stress symptoms \" (\" PTSS \"), [ 312 ] or simply \" post-traumatic stress \" (\" PTS \") in the case of the U.S. Department of Defense , [ 313 ] to avoid stigma associated with the word \"disorder\". The comedian George Carlin criticized the euphemism treadmill which led to progressive change of the way PTSD was referred to over the course of the 20th century, from \" shell shock \" in the First World War to the \"battle fatigue\" in the Second World War , to \"operational exhaustion\" in the Korean War , to the current \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", coined during the Vietnam War , which \"added a hyphen\" and which, he commented, \"completely burie[s] [the pain] under jargon \". He also stated that the name given to the condition has had a direct effect on the way veteran soldiers with PTSD were treated and perceived by civilian populations over time. [ 314 ] Research Most knowledge regarding PTSD comes from studies in high-income countries. [ 315 ] To recapitulate some of the neurological and neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by the veteran population of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, researchers at the Roskamp Institute and the James A Haley Veteran's Hospital (Tampa) have developed an animal model to study the consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PTSD. [ 316 ] In the laboratory, the researchers exposed mice to a repeated session of unpredictable stressor (i.e. predator odor while restrained), and physical trauma in the form of inescapable foot-shock, and this was also combined with a mTBI.

In comparison with other animal studies, [ 316 ] [ 317 ] examination of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune responses in plasma revealed a trend toward increase in corticosterone in PTSD and combination groups. Stellate ganglion block is an experimental procedure for the treatment of PTSD . [ 318 ] Researchers are investigating several experimental FAAH and MAGL-inhibiting drugs in hopes of finding a better treatment for anxiety and stress-related illnesses. [ 319 ] In 2016, the FAAH-inhibitor drug BIA 10-2474 was withdrawn from human trials in France due to adverse effects. [ 320 ] Psychotherapy Trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD (also known as \"exposure-based\" or \"exposure\" psychotherapies), such as prolonged exposure therapy (PE), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and cognitive-reprocessing therapy (CPT) have the most evidence for efficacy and are recommended as first-line treatment for PTSD by almost all clinical practice guidelines. [ 321 ] [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Exposure-based psychotherapies demonstrate efficacy for PTSD caused by different trauma \"types\", such as combat, sexual-assault, or natural disasters.

[ 329 ] [ 330 ] To prevent this confounding factor, it has been suggested that future trials compare MDMA against an active placebo. [ 331 ] There is a lack of trials comparing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to existent first-line treatments for PTSD, such as trauma-focused psychological treatments, which seems to achieve similar or even better outcomes than MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

PMID 29075426 . As detailed in another recent WMH report, conditional risk of PTSD after trauma exposure is 4.0%, but varies significantly by trauma type. The highest conditional risk is associated with being raped (19.0%), physical abuse by a romantic partner (11.7%), being kidnapped (11.0%), and being sexually assaulted other than rape (10.5%). In terms of broader categories, the traumas associated with the highest PTSD risk are those involving intimate partner or sexual violence (11.4%), and other traumas (9.2%), with aggregate conditional risk much lower in the other broad trauma categories (2.0–5.4%) [citations omitted; emphasis added]. ^ Darves-Bornoz JM, Alonso J, de Girolamo G, de Graaf R, Haro JM, Kovess-Masfety V, et al.

    "text": "English French Canada [ a ] is a country in North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the second-largest country by total area , with the longest coastline of any country. Its border with the United States is the longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. With a population of over 41 million, it has widely varying population densities, with the majority residing in its urban areas and large areas being sparsely populated. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories resulting in the displacement of Indigenous populations , and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This increased sovereignty was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 , and culminated in the Canada Act 1982 , which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition . The country's head of government is the prime minister , who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is appointed by the governor general , representing the monarch of Canada , the ceremonial head of state . The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and human rights. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration . Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history , economy , and culture . A developed country , Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by nominal GDP , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks .

Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history , economy , and culture . A developed country , Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by nominal GDP , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Recognized as a middle power , Canada's support for multilateralism and internationalism has been closely related to its foreign policies of peacekeeping and aid for developing countries . Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participation in multiple international organizations and forums . Etymology While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata , meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\". [ 9 ] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona . [ 10 ] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); [ 10 ] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada . [ 10 ] From the 16th to the early 18th century, Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River. [ 11 ] Following the British conquest of New France , this area was known as the British Province of Quebec from 1763 to 1791. [ 12 ] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada . These two colonies were collectively referred to as the Canadas until their union as the Province of Canada in 1841. [ 13 ] Upon Confederation in 1867 , Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title. [ 14 ] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".

[ 16 ] History Indigenous peoples The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. [ 17 ] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. [ 18 ] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. [ 19 ] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. [ 20 ] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Métis , [ 21 ] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity. [ 21 ] The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 [ 23 ] and two million, [ 24 ] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples . [ 25 ] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. [ 26 ] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases , to which they had no natural immunity, [ 27 ] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.

[ 28 ] Although not without conflict, European Canadians ' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. [ 29 ] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada , particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade . [ 30 ] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties . [ 31 ] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society. [ 32 ] Settler colonialism reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [ 33 ] A period of redress began with the formation of a reconciliation commission by the Government of Canada in 2008. [ 34 ] This included acknowledgment of cultural genocide , [ 35 ] settlement agreements , [ 34 ] and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women . [ 36 ] European colonization It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson . [ 38 ] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland .

[ 41 ] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. [ 42 ] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia. [ 43 ] In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I , founded St John's, Newfoundland , as the first North American English seasonal camp . [ 44 ] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence. [ 39 ] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). [ 45 ] Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana . [ 46 ] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.

[ 50 ] British North America The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. [ 16 ] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island ) became a separate colony in 1769. [ 52 ] To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley . [ 53 ] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. [ 54 ] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. [ 55 ] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution . [ 16 ] After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. [ 56 ] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists , the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick , as Canada's first city. [ 57 ] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec ) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario ), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.

[ 60 ] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. [ 61 ] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic -speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances . [ 62 ] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891. [ 23 ] The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837 . [ 63 ] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. [ 16 ] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855. [ 64 ] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute , extending the border westward along the 49th parallel . This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858) .

[ 69 ] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, [ 70 ] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. [ 71 ] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905. [ 71 ] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US. [ 72 ] To open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway ), passed the Dominion Lands Act to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory. [ 73 ] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \" Indian reserves \", [ 74 ] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements . [ 75 ] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.

[ 81 ] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. [ 82 ] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, [ 81 ] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931 , affirmed Canada's independence. [ 83 ] The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. [ 84 ] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas ) in the 1940s and 1950s. [ 85 ] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI , seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence. [ 81 ] The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939.

[ 89 ] After two referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province. [ 90 ] Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965, [ 91 ] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, [ 92 ] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. [ 93 ] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare , the Canada Pension Plan , and Canada Student Loans ; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions. [ 94 ] Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982 , the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . [ 96 ] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy .

[ 141 ] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 square kilometres (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry. [ 142 ] Since the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions . [ 143 ] Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas , including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas . [ 144 ] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas. [ 144 ] Canada's first National Park , Banff National Park was established in 1885. [ 145 ] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park was established in 1893. [ 146 ] Established in 2015, Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area. [ 147 ] Canada's largest national wildlife region, established in 2018, is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area . [ 148 ] Government and politics Canada is described as a \" full democracy \", [ 149 ] with a tradition of liberalism , [ 150 ] and an egalitarian , [ 151 ] moderate political ideology. [ 152 ] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.

[ 158 ] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale. [ 158 ] Five parties had representatives elected to Parliament in the 2025 election —the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition ; the Bloc Québécois ; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left [ 159 ] ); and the Green Party . [ 160 ] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. [ 161 ] Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy —the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative , and judicial branches. [ 162 ] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other sovereign Commonwealth countries [ 163 ] and Canada's 10 provinces . The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general , on the advice of the prime minister , to carry out most of their ceremonial royal duties. [ 164 ] The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada. [ 165 ] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations , [ 166 ] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative ) is otherwise directed by the Cabinet , a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister, [ 167 ] the head of government . To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House. [ 168 ] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown the governor general, lieutenant governors , senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.

[ 166 ] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check. [ 169 ] The Parliament of Canada passes all federal statute laws. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate . While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy , this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law . [ 171 ] Each of the 343 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The Constitution Act, 1982 , requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House. [ 172 ] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. [ 173 ] Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. [ 174 ] Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign, have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces, [ 175 ] and differ structurally from their provincial counterparts. [ 176 ] Law The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. [ 177 ] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.

[ 179 ] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years. [ 180 ] Canada's judiciary interprets laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since 2017 by Richard Wagner , the Chief Justice of Canada . [ 181 ] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice . [ 182 ] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions. [ 183 ] Common law prevails everywhere except Quebec, where civil law predominates. [ 184 ] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. [ 185 ] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. [ 186 ] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police . [ 187 ] Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada. [ 188 ] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. [ 189 ] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 .

These may be grouped into four main regions : Western Canada , Central Canada , Atlantic Canada , and Northern Canada ( Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). [ 192 ] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare , education , and social programs , [ 193 ] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces. [ 194 ] The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown [ 195 ] and power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada [ 196 ] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council , [ 197 ] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867 , are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively [ 198 ] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment , while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.

[ 218 ] Canada's role in developing peacekeeping and its participation in major peacekeeping initiatives during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image. [ 219 ] Peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the United States. [ 220 ] Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations, [ 221 ] such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 invasion of Iraq . [ 221 ] Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined. [ 222 ] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , rather than directly through the UN. [ 223 ] The change to participation via NATO has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties.

[ 301 ] Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. [ 302 ] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups. [ 303 ] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.

[ 311 ] Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. [ 312 ] There are 11 Indigenous language groups , composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. [ 313 ] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. [ 314 ] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory. [ 315 ] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their first language . Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).

[ 321 ] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right. [ 322 ] Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s. [ 320 ] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, [ 323 ] Canada has become a post-Christian , secular state. [ 324 ] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, [ 325 ] they still believe in God. [ 326 ] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter. [ 327 ] According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population, [ g ] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent. [ 330 ] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).

[ 332 ] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984 [ 333 ] and is universal .

[ 336 ] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs. [ 337 ] In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years. [ 289 ] Life expectancy is 81.1 years. [ 338 ] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\". [ 339 ] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use. [ 340 ] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes . [ 340 ] Four chronic diseases— cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases , respiratory diseases , and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. [ 341 ] There are approximately 8 million people aged 15 and older with one or more disabilities in Canada . [ 342 ] In 2024, the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated that healthcare spending reached $372 billion, or 12.4 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.

[ 345 ] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last. [ 346 ] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage. [ 346 ] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals, [ 347 ] and hospital capacity. [ 348 ] Education Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly , funded and overseen by federal , provincial , and local governments . [ 350 ] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government. [ 351 ] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education , followed by secondary and post-secondary education . Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada. [ 352 ] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. [ 353 ] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.

[ 361 ] Culture Historically, Canada has been influenced by British , French , and Indigenous cultures and traditions. [ 363 ] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. [ 364 ] Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a just society are constitutionally protected. [ 365 ] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized human rights and inclusiveness for all its people. [ 366 ] Canadian identity shifted from primarily British-based to multicultural between the 1960s and 1970s. [ 367 ] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments [ 368 ] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. [ 369 ] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture. [ 370 ] As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic of regional ethnic subcultures with diverse areas and ethnic enclaves . [ 371 ] Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration , social integration , and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. [ 372 ] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment , strong efforts to eliminate poverty , strict gun control , a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination ) and LGBT rights , and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.

[ 376 ] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, northern climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols. [ 377 ] The use of the maple leaf as a symbol dates to the early 18th century in New France. [ 378 ] The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the arms of Canada . [ 379 ] Canada's official tartan, known as the \" maple leaf tartan \", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring , gold in the early autumn , red at the first frost , and brown after falling. [ 380 ] The arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom , with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. [ 381 ] Other prominent symbols include the national motto, \" A mari usque ad mare \" (\"from sea to sea\"), [ 382 ] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse , the beaver , Canada goose , common loon , Canadian horse , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, [ 379 ] and, more recently, the Indigenous totem pole and Inuksuk .

[ 385 ] Literature Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. [ 387 ] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration. [ 388 ] This developed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality . [ 389 ] The evolution of Canadian literature is intricately linked to the country's historical and social contexts, often mirroring the challenges and changes in Canadian society. [ 390 ] As Canadian literature progressed into the 20th and 21st centuries, it began to address a broader array of subjects and themes, such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant experiences, environmental issues, the relationship with Indigenous peoples, and Canadian values and identity. [ 391 ] Financial support from governmental bodies, such as the Canada Council for the Arts and various provincial grant programs, facilitates the creation, publication, and promotion of works by Canadian authors . [ 392 ] Numerous Canadian authors have received international literary awards including the Nobel Prize in Literature , the Booker Prize , and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction .

    "text": "An automated external defibrillator ( AED ) is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia , [ 1 ] and is able to treat them through defibrillation , the application of electricity which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm. With simple audio and visual commands, AEDs are designed to be simple to use for the layperson, and the use of AEDs is taught in many first aid , certified first responder , and basic life support (BLS) level cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) classes. [ 2 ] The portable version of the defibrillator was invented in the mid-1960s by Frank Pantridge in Belfast , Northern Ireland and the first automatic, public-use defibrillator was produced by the Cardiac Resuscitation Company in the late 1970s. The unit was launched under the name Heart-Aid. [ 3 ] Indications Conditions that the device treats An automated external defibrillator is used in cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias which lead to sudden cardiac arrest , which is not the same as a heart attack. The rhythms that the device will treat are usually limited to: Pulseless Ventricular tachycardia (shortened to VT or V-Tach) [ 1 ] Ventricular fibrillation (shortened to VF or V-Fib) In each of these two types of shockable cardiac arrhythmia , the heart is electrically active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and circulate blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole . AEDs, like all defibrillators, are not designed to shock asystole ('flat line' patterns) as this will not have a positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried",

The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator. Effect of delayed treatment Uncorrected, these cardiac conditions (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole) rapidly lead to irreversible brain damage and death, once cardiac arrest takes place. After approximately three to five minutes in cardiac arrest, [ 4 ] irreversible brain/tissue damage may begin to occur. For every minute that a person in cardiac arrest goes without being successfully treated (by defibrillation), the chance of survival decreases by 7 percent per minute in the first three minutes, and decreases by 10 percent per minute as time advances beyond ~three minutes. [ 5 ] Requirements for use AEDs are designed to be used by laypersons who may not have received AED training. However, sixth-grade students have been reported to begin defibrillation within 90 seconds, as opposed to a trained operator beginning within 67 seconds. [ 6 ] This is in contrast to more sophisticated manual and semi-automatic defibrillators used by health professionals, which can act as a pacemaker if the heart rate is too slow ( bradycardia ) and perform other functions which require a skilled operator able to read electrocardiograms . Bras with a metal underwire and piercings on the torso must be removed before using the AED on someone to avoid interference. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The American television show MythBusters found evidence that use of a defibrillator on a woman wearing an underwire bra can lead to arcing or fire but only in unusual and unlikely circumstances. [ 9 ] In a study analyzing the effects of having AEDs immediately present during Chicago's Heart Start program over a two-year period, of 22 individuals, 18 were in a cardiac arrhythmia which AEDs can treat. Of these 18, 11 survived. Of these 11 patients, 6 were treated by bystanders with absolutely no",

Of these 18, 11 survived. Of these 11 patients, 6 were treated by bystanders with absolutely no previous training in AED use. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Implementation Placement and availability Automated external defibrillators are generally either kept where health professionals and first responders can use them (health facilities and ambulances) as well as public access units which can be found in public places including corporate and government offices, shopping centres, restaurants, hotels, public transport, and any other location where people may congregate. In order to make them highly visible, public access AEDs are often brightly coloured and are mounted in protective cases near the entrance of a building. When these protective cases are opened or the defibrillator is removed, some will sound a buzzer to alert nearby staff to their removal, though this does not necessarily summon emergency services; trained AED operators should know to phone for an ambulance when sending for or using an AED. In September 2008, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation issued a 'universal AED sign' to be adopted throughout the world to indicate the presence of an AED, and this is shown on the right. [ 12 ] A trend that is developing is the purchase of AEDs to be used in the home, particularly by those with known existing heart conditions. [ 13 ] The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels. There has been some concern among medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have appropriate training, [ 14 ] and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed. Typically, an AED kit will contain a face shield for providing a barrier between patient and first aider during rescue breathing; a pair of nitrile rubber gloves; a pair of trauma shears for cutting through a patient's clothing to expose the chest; a small towel for wiping away any moisture on the chest, and a razor for shaving those with very hairy chests.

[ 15 ] Preparation for operation Most manufacturers recommend checking the AED before every period of duty or on a regular basis for fixed units. Some units need to be switched on in order to perform a self check; other models have a self check system built in with a visible indicator. All manufacturers mark their electrode pads with an expiration date, and it is important to ensure that the pads are in date. The typical life expectancy of AED pads are between 18 and 30 months. [ 16 ] This is usually marked on the outside of the pads. Some models are designed to make this date visible through a 'window', although others will require the opening of the case to find the date stamp. [ 17 ] It is also important to ensure that the AED unit's batteries have not expired. The AED manufacturer will specify how often the batteries should be replaced. Each AED has a different recommended maintenance schedule outlined in the user manual. Common checkpoints on every checklist, however, also include a monthly check of the battery power by checking the green indicator light when powered on, condition and cleanliness of all cables and the unit, and check for the adequate supplies. [ 18 ] Mechanism of operation An AED is \"automatic\" because of the unit's ability to autonomously analyse the patient's condition. To assist this, the vast majority of units have spoken prompts, and some may also have visual displays to instruct the user. \"External\" refers to the fact that the operator applies the electrode pads to the bare chest of the victim (as opposed to internal defibrillators , which have electrodes surgically implanted inside the body of a patient). When turned on or opened, the AED will instruct the user to connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient. Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient so as to avoid false readings by the unit. The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation",

Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient so as to avoid false readings by the unit. The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. The device system is not only safer - charging only when required, but also allows for a faster delivery of the electric current. When charged, the device instructs the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and then to press a button to deliver the shock; human intervention is usually required to deliver the shock to the patient in order to avoid the possibility of accidental injury to another person (which can result from a responder or bystander touching the patient at the time of the shock). Depending on the manufacturer and particular model, after the shock is delivered most devices will analyze the patient and either instruct CPR to be performed, or prepare to administer another shock. Many AED units have an 'event memory' which store the ECG of the patient along with details of the time the unit was activated and the number and strength of any shocks delivered. Some units also have voice recording abilities [ 19 ] to monitor the actions taken by the personnel in order to ascertain if these had any impact on the survival outcome. All this recorded data can be either downloaded to a computer or printed out so that the providing organisation or responsible body is able to see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation. Some AED units even provide feedback on the quality of the compressions provided by the rescuer. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The first commercially available AEDs were all of a monophasic type, which gave a high-energy shock, up to 360 to 400 joules depending on the model. This caused increased cardiac injury and in some cases second and third-degree burns around the shock pad sites. Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120–200 joules, with each shock",

Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120–200 joules, with each shock moving in an opposite polarity between the pads. Others may give a stepped approach to energy delivery, usually in a 200J, a second 200J, then 300J, and finally 360J shock, with any further shocks also being 360 Joules. This lower-energy waveform has proven more effective in clinical tests, as well as offering a reduced rate of complications and reduced recovery time. [ 22 ] Usage Simplicity of use Unlike regular defibrillators , an automated external defibrillator (AED) requires minimal training to be used (or even no training). That is possible because all AEDs approved for use in the United States and many other countries use an electronic voice to prompt users through each step. Many AEDs now include visual prompts in case of a hearing impaired user. Most units are designed for use by non-medical operators. Their ease of use has given rise to the notion of public access defibrillation (PAD). An AED automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. Automatic models will administer the shock without the user's command. Semi-automatic models will tell the user that a shock is needed, but the user must tell the machine to do so, usually by pressing a button. In most circumstances, the user cannot override a \"no shock\" advisory by an AED. Some AEDs may be used on children – those under 55 lbs (25 kg) in weight or under age 8. If a particular model of AED is approved for pediatric use, all that is required is the use of more appropriate pads [ failed verification ] . [ 23 ] Benefit Observational studies have shown that in out of hospital cardiac arrest, public access defibrillators when used were associated with 40% median survival. When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival. [ 24 ] Liability Automated external defibrillators are now easy enough",

When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival. [ 24 ] Liability Automated external defibrillators are now easy enough to use that most states in the United States include the \"good faith\" use of an AED by any person under Good Samaritan laws . [ 25 ] \"Good faith\" protection under a Good Samaritan law means that a volunteer responder (not acting as a part of one's occupation) cannot be held civilly liable for the harm or death of a victim by providing improper or inadequate care, given that the harm or death was not intentional and the responder was acting within the limits of their training and in good faith. In the United States, Good Samaritan laws provide some protection for the use of AEDs by trained and untrained responders. [ 26 ] AEDs create little liability if used correctly; [ 27 ] NREMT-B and many state Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training and many CPR classes incorporate or offer AED education as a part of their program. In addition to Good Samaritan laws, Ontario, Canada also has the \" Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability), 2007 (Bill 171 – Subsection N)\", passed in June, 2007, [ 28 ] which protects individuals from liability for damages that may occur from their use of an AED to save someone's life at the immediate scene of an emergency unless damages are caused by gross negligence. Legislation in Australia varies by state, with separate liability issues relating to providing and using AED equipment. Each state and territory has enacted \"Good Samaritan\" laws that offer legal protection to a person who gives assistance in a medical emergency - the standard of care expected corresponds to their training (or lack of training). [ 29 ] In New South Wales, the Work Health and Safety Regulation (2011) requires an employer to use a risk assessment to ensure that there is adequate provision for first aid; when there is a sufficient risk it warrants providing a defibrillator.

[ 30 ] Reliability In 2012, AED's (automated external defibrillators) were under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which considered reclassifying AEDs as class III premarket approval devices. Technical malfunctions likely contributed to more than 750 deaths in the 5-year period between 2004 and 2009, in most cases by component failures or design errors. During the same period, up to 70 types of AEDs were recalled, including recalls from every AED manufacturer in the world. [ 31 ] In January and February 2015, the FDA issued this news release: \"The FDA issued a final order that will require AED manufacturers to submit premarket approval applications (PMAs), which undergo a more rigorous review than what was required to market these devices in the past. The agency's strengthened review will focus on the critical requirements needed to ensure the safety and reliability of AEDs and their necessary accessories, including batteries, pad electrodes, adapters and hardware keys for pediatric use.\" [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In the United Kingdom there is concern that poor maintenance may make public defibrillators unreliable. Regular inspections and readiness checks are essential to maintaining AED effectiveness over time. The Henley Standard reported on 21 July 2017 that more than half the defibrillators in Henley-on-Thames and the surrounding area were at risk of failing, either because of low battery power or because adhesive pads had deteriorated. History The first use of an external defibrillator on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck. [ 34 ] The portable version of the external defibrillator was invented in 1957 by Frank Pantridge in Belfast , Northern Ireland , a pioneer in emergency medical treatment. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Pantridge's defibrillator required a trained operator to perform the shock procedure and charted a course for many new innovations in external defibrillation. [ 37 ] In the late",

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Pantridge's defibrillator required a trained operator to perform the shock procedure and charted a course for many new innovations in external defibrillation. [ 37 ] In the late 1970s the Heart-Aid was developed as the first truly automated external defibrillator that was designed for the public. The principles of ABC assessment and a human voice relaying instructions helped bystanders respond to a sudden cardiac event while waiting for the first responders to get to scene. [ 3 ] Many of the early innovations in the Heart-Aid model are still part of the current generation of AEDs, although some innovations, like the airway electrode have fallen from use. Case studies In a study published in 2017, researchers in Poland selected the main entrances of buildings which had AEDs, although the researchers themselves did not know the exact locations of the devices. In mock cardiac arrest scenarios, the average time to bring the AED to the patient was 96 seconds, with a time that ranged from 52 to 144 seconds. This met the three minute goal. In some cases, the use of the AED required the continuous presence of building personnel. Future improvements include more obvious signage and public-access AEDs which do not require a staff member of the building to either retrieve or use the device.

Set in the mid-1970s, it details a group of white anti-apartheid activists seeking to overthrow the South African government. It follows the life of Rosa Burger as she comes to terms with her father's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party . Gordimer was involved in South African politics and knew Bram Fischer , Nelson Mandela 's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the novel's Burger family on Fischer's family and described Burger's Daughter as an homage to Fischer. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom in 1979. It was banned in South Africa a month after its publication, and its import and sale were prohibited by the South African Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the ban and restrictions were lifted.

[ 2 ] It is generally characterized by widespread violence , destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces . Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. [ 3 ] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets , and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties . Etymology The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre and werre , from Old French werre ( guerre as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish * werra , ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic * werzō ' mixture, confusion ' . The word is related to the Old Saxon werran , Old High German werran , and the modern German verwirren , meaning ' to confuse, to perplex, to bring into confusion ' . [ 4 ] History Anthropologists disagree about whether warfare was common throughout human prehistory, or whether it was a more recent development, following the invention of agriculture or organised states. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] It is difficult to determine whether warfare occurred during the Paleolithic due to the sparseness of known remains. Some sources claim that most Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies were possibly fundamentally egalitarian [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and may have rarely or never engaged in organized violence between groups (i.e. war). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Evidence of violent conflict appears to increase during the Mesolithic period, from around 10,000 years ago onwards.

[ 5 ] Raymond Case Kelly , a cultural anthropologist and ethnologist from the US, claimed that before 400,000 years ago, groups of people clashed like groups of chimpanzees, however, later they preferred \"positive and peaceful social relations between neighboring groups, such as joint hunting, trading, and courtship.\" [ 18 ] In his book \"Warless Societies and the Origin of War\" he explores the origins of modern wars and states that high surplus product encourages conflict, so \"raiding often begins in the richest environments\". [ 19 ] In War Before Civilization , Lawrence H. Keeley , a professor at the University of Illinois , says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, [ 20 ] and many fought constantly. [ 21 ] Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids , large raids, and massacres . All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. [ 22 ] Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids. [ 23 ] William Rubinstein wrote \"Pre-literate societies, even those organized in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.'\" [ 24 ] Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, [ 25 ] military activity has continued over much of the globe. In Europe the oldest known battlefield is thought to date to 1250 BC. [ 26 ] The Bronze Age has been described as a key period in the intensification of warfare, with the emergence of dedicated warriors and the development of metal weapons like swords. [ 27 ] Two other commonly named periods of increase are the Axial Age and Modern Times.

In Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992 , Charles Tilly , professor of history, sociology, and social science at the University of Michigan and the Columbia University, described as \"the founding father of 21st-century sociology\" [ 29 ] argued that ‘War made the state, and the state made war,’ saying that wars have led to creation of states which in their turn perpetuate war. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Tilly's theory of state formation is considered dominant in the state formation literature. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Since 1945, great power wars, interstate wars, [ 35 ] territorial conquests and war declarations have declined in frequency . [ 36 ] Wars have been increasingly regulated by international humanitarian law . [ 36 ] Battle deaths and casualties have declined, in part due to advances in military medicine [ 37 ] and despite advances in weapons. In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place, but no battle has taken place since 1945. [ 38 ] However, war in some aspects has not necessarily declined. [ 36 ] Civil wars have increased in absolute terms since 1945. [ 36 ] A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies. [ 39 ] The major exceptions were the Korean War , the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 , the Iran–Iraq War , the Gulf War , the Eritrean–Ethiopian War , and the Russo-Ukrainian War .

This can be conducted through sophisticated technologies, like cluster munitions , [ 41 ] or with rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind enemy lines, [ 42 ] and can include weaponized or non-weaponized pathogens. Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I , and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians. [ 43 ] Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic warfare , political warfare , covert operations , espionage , cyberwarfare , or proxy wars . Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which nuclear , biological , chemical or radiological weapons are not used or see limited deployment. Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems. Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, where irregular forces take up arms to change an existing political order. An insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency , and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime. Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation). [ 44 ] Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation. Radiological warfare is any form of warfare involving deliberate radiation poisoning or contamination of an area with radiological sources.

Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of war , placing no limits on legitimate military targets , using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties , or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population. Unconventional warfare can be defined as \"military and quasi-military operations other than conventional warfare \" [ 45 ] and may use covert forces or actions such as subversion , diversion , sabotage , espionage , biowarfare , sanctions , propaganda or guerrilla warfare . Aims Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve. [ 46 ] Definition Fried defines war aims as \"the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war\". [ 47 ] Classification Tangible/intangible aims: Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the Anglo-Dutch Wars ). Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation [ 48 ] – may have more tangible expression (\"conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power\"). [ 49 ] Explicit/implicit aims: Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions. Implicit war aims [ 50 ] can take the form of minutes of discussion, memoranda and instructions. [ 51 ] Positive/negative aims: \"Positive war aims\" cover tangible outcomes. \"Negative war aims\" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes. [ 52 ] War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into \"peace conditions\" [ 53 ] – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war.

Daily life is interrupted, travel to or across the area may be difficult and international visitors may be advised to leave the area. [ 55 ] Casualties Estimates for total deaths due to war vary widely. In one estimate, primitive warfare from 50,000 to 3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million±133,000 victims based on the assumption that it accounted for the 15.1% of all deaths. [ 57 ] Ian Morris estimated that the rate could be as high as 20%. [ 58 ] Other scholars find the prehistoric percentage much lower, around 2%, similar to the Neanderthals and ancestors of apes and primates. [ 59 ] For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from 151 million [ 60 ] to several billion. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The lowest estimate for history of 151 million was calculated by William Eckhardt. He explained his method as summing the recorded casualties and multiplying their average by the number of recorded battles or wars. This method excludes indirect deaths for premodern wars and all deaths for unrecorded wars. Few premodern wars were recorded beyond Eurasia and only 18 wars were recorded for period 3000 - 1500 BC worldwide. [ 63 ] Later researches shifted from Eckhardt's approach to general estimations of the percentage of population killed by wars.

[ 73 ] Largest wars by death toll The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is World War II , from 1939 to 1945, with 70–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests [ 74 ] at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties ). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. [ 75 ] War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine , large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).

These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II , or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls. [ 82 ] On military personnel Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder , disease, injury, and death. In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire. — No More Heroes , Richard Gabriel [ 38 ] Swank and Marchand's World War II study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders. [ 95 ] One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees. — 14–18: Understanding the Great War , Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker [ 38 ] Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder . [ 95 ] Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War , including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.

United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I , 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. [ 97 ] During Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians. [ 98 ] Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. [ 99 ] In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the Seven Years' War , the Royal Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were 'missing'. [ 100 ] It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war. [ 101 ] On civilians Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine , disease, and death in the civilian population ). During the Thirty Years' War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide , while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes.

[ 106 ] Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been. [ 107 ] Economic Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions. [ 108 ] Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II . Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery, though it did help in reducing unemployment. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] In most cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War , and World War I , warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917 .

[ 117 ] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries. [ 118 ] Theories of motivation There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common. [ 119 ] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said, \"Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.\" [ 120 ] Psychoanalytic Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, \"War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.\" [ 121 ] Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent. [ 122 ] This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races , religions , nations or ideologies . By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari , a follower of Melanie Klein , thought war was the paranoid or projective \"elaboration\" of mourning. [ 123 ] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \"love need\": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings",

For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation. Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. [ 124 ] Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. [ 125 ] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler . Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war. Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country. — Hermann Göring at the Nuremberg trials , 18 April 1946 [ 126 ] Evolutionary Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.

[ 127 ] The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees , [ 128 ] as well as in many ant species, [ 129 ] group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states. [ 130 ] Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. [ b ] He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (\" honor \"). [ b ] Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which \"coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups\", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking \"tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors\". [ 132 ] Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. [ 133 ] Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay peninsula.

[ 135 ] Economic War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity . [ 136 ] While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.S. Generals , expressed support for an economic view of war. Marxist The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ( imperialist ) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism . Marxist economists Karl Kautsky , Rosa Luxemburg , Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets . Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand . Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism. [ 139 ] Demographic Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories: Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict. Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade , advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said: For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultiv",

Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. [ 140 ] This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine . [ 141 ] The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria , Mali , Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] According to Heinsohn , who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the \"fighting age\" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Heinsohn saw both past \"Christianist\" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. [ 147 ] Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789, [ 148 ] and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.

[ 149 ] The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge. [ 150 ] Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, [ 151 ] Population Action International , [ 152 ] and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development . [ 153 ] Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination. [ 154 ] Cultural Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the \"Western way of war\" based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline. [ 155 ] Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, \"the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they're attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.\" Discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small \"artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency. [ 156 ] Rationalist Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations) ) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.

[ 157 ] Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain , would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game , optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In \"Rationalist Explanations for War\", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war: Issue indivisibilities Incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry Commitment problems [ 157 ] \"Issue indivisibility\" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other. \" Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent\" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, \"war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.\" [ 158 ] Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments. [ 159 ] Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias , [ 160 ] but are still \"as rational as you and me\". [ 161 ] According to philosopher Iain King , \"Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....\" [ 162 ] King asserts that \"Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink \" which is faulty, but still rational.

The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars. [ 164 ] Political science The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I . More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program . [ 165 ] The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often used by political scientists since then. [ 166 ] : 143 There are several different international relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma . [ 166 ] : 145 Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau , and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer , two main sub-theories are: Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and \"movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing.\" [ 166 ] : 147 However, evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.

[ 166 ] : 148 On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more equally distributed. This \"power preponderance\" hypothesis has empirical support. [ 166 ] : 148 The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance. [ 166 ] : 148 Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. Critics respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. [ 166 ] : 149 Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. [ 166 ] : 150 Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with each other. [ 166 ] : 150 Diversionary theory , also known as the \"scapegoat hypothesis\", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support. [ 166 ] : 152 This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding , and a significant domestic \"rally effect\" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin. [ 166 ] : 152–13 However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed. [ 166 ] : 152–53 U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory. [ 167 ] These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. [ 166 ] : 157 For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases , [ 166 ] : 157 such as prospect theory .

[ 166 ] : 157 For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases , [ 166 ] : 157 such as prospect theory . [ 168 ] Ethics The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years. [ 169 ] The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory , are jus ad bellum and jus in bello . [ 170 ] Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. [ 174 ] The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. [ 174 ] Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent. [ 175 ] The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in international law 's regulations on legitimate war. [ 169 ] Lewis Coser, an American conflict theorist and sociologist, argued that conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.

Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society. [ 176 ] Limiting and stopping Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes : \"Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.\" [ 177 ] Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I , World War II , and the Vietnam War . In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq . Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Pauses During a war, the parties may agree to pauses. A ceasefire is a stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions (often due to mediation by a third party). [ 178 ] Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. [ 179 ] A ceasefire can be temporary with an intended end date or may be intended to last indefinitely. A ceasefire is distinct from an armistice in that the armistice is a formal end to a war whereas a ceasefire may be a temporary stoppage. [ 180 ] The immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary. Ceasefires may be intended to meet short-term limited needs (such as providing humanitarian aid), manage a conflict to make it less devastating, or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute. [ 181 ] An actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict (for example, by re-arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary), which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented.

[ 182 ] [ 181 ] [ 183 ] The durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors, such as demilitarized zones, withdrawal of troops and third-party guarantees and monitoring (e.g. peacekeeping ). Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack, reduce uncertainty about the adversary's intentions, and when mechanisms are put in place to prevent accidents from spiraling into conflict. [ 182 ] See also Outline of war Notes ^ The term \"armed conflict\" is used instead of, or in addition to, the term \"war\" with the former being more general in scope. The International Committee of the Red Cross differentiates between international and non-international armed conflict in their definition, \"International armed conflicts exist whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States.... Non-international armed conflicts are protracted armed confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the forces of one or more armed groups, or between such groups arising on the territory of a State [party to the Geneva Conventions]. The armed confrontation must reach a minimum level of intensity and the parties involved in the conflict must show a minimum of organisation.\" [ 1 ] ^ a b The argument is made from pages 314 to 332 of The Blank Slate . [ 131 ] Relevant quotes include on p332 \"The first step in understanding violence is to set aside our abhorrence of it long enough to examine why it can sometimes pay off in evolutionary terms.\", \"Natural selection is powered by competition, which means that the products of natural selection – survival machines, in Richard Dawkins metaphor – should, by default, do whatever helps them survive and reproduce.\". On p323 \"If an obstacle stands in the way of something an organism needs, it should neutralize the obstacle by disabling or eliminating it.\", \"Another human obstacle consists of men monopolozing women who could otherwise be taken as wives.\", \"The competition can be violent\".

On p324 \"So people have invented, and perhaps evolved, an alternate defense: the advertised deterrence policy known as lex talionis , the law of retaliation, familiar from the biblical injunction \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\" If you can credibly say to potential adversaries, \"We won't attack first, but if we are attacked, we will survive and strike back,\" you remove Hobbes's first two incentives for quarrel, gain and mistrust.\". On p326 \"Also necessary for vengeance to work as a deterrent is that the willingness to pursue it be made public, because the whole point of deterrence is to give would-be attackers second thoughts beforehand . And this brings us to Hobbes's final reason for quarrel. Thirdly, glory – though a more accurate word would be \"honor\".\" References ^ \"How is the Term \"Armed Conflict\" Defined in International Humanitarian Law?\" (PDF) .

A state with greater military capacity than its adversary is more likely to prevail in wars with 'total' war aims – the overthrow of a foreign government or annexation of territory – than in wars with more limited objectives. ^ Fried, Marvin Benjamin (1 July 2014).

War aims are the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war. ^ Welch distinguishes: \"tangible goods such as arms, wealth, and – provided they are strategically or economically valuable – territory and resources\" from \"intangible goods such as credibility and reputation\" – Welch, David A.

[Churchill] took office and declared he had 'not become the King's First Minister to oversee the liquidation of the British empire'. [...] His view was that an Anglo-American English-speaking alliance would seek to preserve the empire, though ending it was among Roosevelt's implicit war aims. ^ Compare Fried, Marvin Benjamin (1 July 2014). At times, war aims were explicitly stated internally or externally in a policy decision, while at other times [...] the war aims were merely discussed but not published, remaining instead in the form of memoranda or instructions. ^ Fried, Marvin Benjamin (1 July 2015). \" 'A Life and Death Question': Austro-Hungarian War Aims in the First World War\" .

    "text": "Injury is physiological damage to the living tissue of any organism, whether in humans , in other animals , or in plants . Injuries can be caused in many ways, including mechanically with penetration by sharp objects such as teeth or with blunt objects , by heat or cold, or by venoms and biotoxins . Injury prompts an inflammatory response in many taxa of animals; this prompts wound healing . In both plants and animals, substances are often released to help to occlude the wound, limiting loss of fluids and the entry of pathogens such as bacteria. Many organisms secrete antimicrobial chemicals which limit wound infection; in addition, animals have a variety of immune responses for the same purpose. Both plants and animals have regrowth mechanisms which may result in complete or partial healing over the injury. Cells too can repair damage to a certain degree. Taxonomic range Animals Injury in animals is sometimes defined as mechanical damage to anatomical structure, [ 1 ] but it has a wider connotation of physical damage with any cause, including drowning , burns , and poisoning . [ 2 ] Such damage may result from attempted predation , territorial fights, falls, and abiotic factors. [ 2 ] Injury prompts an inflammatory response in animals of many different phyla ; [ 3 ] this prompts coagulation of the blood or body fluid, [ 4 ] followed by wound healing , which may be rapid, as in the cnidaria . [ 3 ] Arthropods are able to repair injuries to the cuticle that forms their exoskeleton to some extent. [ 5 ] Animals in several phyla, including annelids , arthropods, cnidaria, molluscs , nematodes , and vertebrates are able to produce antimicrobial peptides to fight off infection following an injury. [ 1 ] Injury in humans has been studied extensively for its importance in medicine . Much of medical practice, including emergency medicine and pain management , is dedicated to the treatment of injuries. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The World Health Organization has developed a classification of injuries in humans by categories including mechanism, objects/substances producing injury, place of occurrence, activity when injured and the role of human intent. [ 8 ] In addition to physical harm, injuries can cause psychological harm, including post-traumatic stress disorder . [ 9 ] Plants In plants, injuries result from the eating of plant parts by herbivorous animals including insects and mammals , [ 10 ] from",

[ 8 ] In addition to physical harm, injuries can cause psychological harm, including post-traumatic stress disorder . [ 9 ] Plants In plants, injuries result from the eating of plant parts by herbivorous animals including insects and mammals , [ 10 ] from damage to tissues by plant pathogens such as bacteria and fungi , which may gain entry after herbivore damage or in other ways, [ 11 ] and from abiotic factors such as heat, [ 12 ] freezing, [ 13 ] flooding, [ 14 ] lightning, [ 15 ] and pollutants [ 16 ] such as ozone. [ 17 ] Plants respond to injury by signalling that damage has occurred, [ 18 ] by secreting materials to seal off the damaged area, [ 19 ] by producing antimicrobial chemicals, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and in woody plants by regrowing over wounds. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Cell injury Cell injury is a variety of changes of stress that a cell suffers due to external as well as internal environmental changes. Amongst other causes, this can be due to physical, chemical, infectious, biological, nutritional or immunological factors. Cell damage can be reversible or irreversible. Depending on the extent of injury, the cellular response may be adaptive and where possible, homeostasis is restored. [ 25 ] Cell death occurs when the severity of the injury exceeds the cell's ability to repair itself. [ 26 ] Cell death is relative to both the length of exposure to a harmful stimulus and the severity of the damage caused. [ 25 ] References ^ a b Rennolds, Corey W.; Bely, Alexandra E.

    "text": "A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint , or on its own to provide support for the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage is used to hold the dressing in place. Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages, which are used to reduce swellings or to provide support to a sprained joint. Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily. Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specially shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body. Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material. In American English , the word bandage is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage . Types Gauze bandage (common gauze roller bandage) The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa [ clarification needed ] absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place. Adhesive bandage Liquid bandage Compression bandage The term \"compression bandage\" refers to a wide variety of bandages with many different applications: Short stretch compression bandages are applied to a limb (usually for treatment of lymphedema or venous ulcers ). [ citation needed ] This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for long-term treatment. Conversely, the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure. Long stretch compression bandages have long stretch properties, meaning that their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. However, they also have a very high resting pressure and must be removed at night or if the patient is in a resting position.

Triangular bandage Also known as a cravat bandage, a triangular bandage is a piece of cloth put into a right-angled triangle, and often provided with safety pins to secure it in place. It can be used fully unrolled as a sling, folded as a normal bandage, or for specialized applications, such as on the head. One advantage of this type of bandage is that it can be makeshift and made from a fabric scrap or a piece of clothing. The Boy Scouts popularized the use of this bandage in many of their first aid lessons, as a part of the uniform is a \"neckerchief\" that can easily be folded to form a cravat. Tube bandage A tube bandage is applied using an applicator, and is woven in a continuous circle. It is used to hold dressings or splints on to limbs, or to provide support to sprains and strains, so that it stops bleeding. Kirigami bandage A new type of bandage was invented in 2016; inspired by the art of kirigami , it uses parallel slits to better fit areas of the body that bend. The bandages have been produced with 3D-printed molds.

Much of the early defining mathematics, science, artistic thought ( architecture , sculpture), theatre , literature , philosophy , and politics of Western civilization derives from this period of Greek history , which had a powerful influence on the later Roman Empire . Part of the broader era of classical antiquity , the classical Greek era ended after Philip II 's unification of most of the Greek world against the common enemy of the Persian Empire, which was conquered within 13 years during the wars of Alexander the Great , Philip's son. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of ancient Greece , the Classical period corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC).

From the perspective of Athenian culture in classical Greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century BC extends slightly into the 6th century BC. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 BC, with the fall of the last Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes ' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek world might place its beginning at the Ionian Revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians were defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt , in 481–479 BC, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day Greece (north of the Isthmus of Corinth ) at a crucial point during the war following the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium .

After both sides were exhausted, a brief peace followed; then the war resumed in Sparta's favor. Athens was decisively defeated in 404 BC, and internal unrest marked the end of the 5th century BC in Greece. Since its beginning, Sparta had been ruled by a diarchy . This meant that Sparta had two kings ruling concurrently throughout its entire history. The two kingships were both hereditary, vested in the Agiad dynasty and the Eurypontid dynasty. According to legend, the respective hereditary lines of these two dynasties sprang from Eurysthenes and Procles , twin descendants of Hercules . They were said to have conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War . Athens under Cleisthenes In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias , son of Peisistratos . Cleomenes I , king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras . But his rival Cleisthenes , with the support of the middle class and aided by pro-democracy citizens, took over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through Cleisthenes' reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)—and established ostracism . The isonomic and isegoric (equal freedom of speech) [ 4 ] democracy was first organized into about 130 demes , which became the basic civic element. The 10,000 citizens exercised their power as members of the assembly ( ἐκκλησία , ekklesia ), headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random.

The territory of the city was also divided into thirty trittyes as follows: ten trittyes in the coastal region ( παρᾰλία , paralia ) ten trittyes in the ἄστυ ( astu ), the urban centre ten trittyes in the rural interior, ( μεσογεία , mesogia ). A tribe consisted of three trittyes, selected at random, one from each of the three groups. Each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors. It was this corpus of reforms that allowed the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s BC. The Persian Wars In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey ), the Greek cities, which included great centres such as Miletus and Halicarnassus , were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid-6th century BC. In 499 BC that region's Greeks rose in the Ionian Revolt , and Athens and some other Greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 BC at the Battle of Lade . Asia Minor returned to Persian control. In 492 BC, the Persian general Mardonius led a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia . He was victorious and again subjugated the former and conquered the latter, [ 5 ] but he was wounded and forced to retreat back into Asia Minor. In addition, a fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied Mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of Mount Athos .

(Historians are uncertain about their number of men; accounts vary from 18,000 to 100,000.) They landed in Attica intending to take Athens, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army of 9,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plataeans led by the Athenian general Miltiades . The Persian fleet continued to Athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault. In 480 BC, Darius' successor Xerxes I sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the Hellespont . This army took Thrace, before descending on Thessaly and Boeotia, whilst the Persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops. The Greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block Cape Artemision . After being delayed by Leonidas I , the Spartan king of the Agiad Dynasty, at the Battle of Thermopylae (a battle made famous by the 300 Spartans who faced the entire Persian army), Xerxes advanced into Attica, and captured and burned Athens . The subsequent Battle of Artemisium resulted in the capture of Euboea , bringing most of mainland Greece north of the Isthmus of Corinth under Persian control.

A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias , defeated the Persian army at Plataea . The Persians then began to withdraw from Greece, and never attempted an invasion again. The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians from the Aegean Sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the Battle of Mycale ; then in 478 BC the fleet captured Byzantium . At that time Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the Delian League , so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos . The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power. The Peloponnesian War Origins of the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League In 431 BC war broke out between Athens and Sparta . The war was a struggle not merely between two city-states but rather between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states: [ 6 ] the Delian League , led by Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. The Delian League grew out of the need to present a unified front of all Greek city-states against Persian aggression. In 481 BC, Greek city-states, including Sparta, met in the first of a series of \"congresses\" that strove to unify all the Greek city-states against the danger of another Persian invasion. [ 7 ] The coalition that emerged from the first congress was named the \"Hellenic League\" and included Sparta. Persia, under Xerxes, invaded Greece in September 481 BC, but the Athenian navy defeated the Persian navy.

The Persian land forces were delayed in 480 BC by a much smaller force of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans and 700 men from Boeotian Thespiae at the Battle of Thermopylae . [ 8 ] The Persians left Greece in 479 BC after their defeat at Plataea . [ 9 ] Plataea was the final battle of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. After this, the Persians never again tried to invade Greece. With the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the Hellenic League. [ 10 ] In 477, Athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include Sparta. This coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of Delos. [ 11 ] Thus, the League took the name \"Delian League\". Its formal purpose was to liberate Greek cities still under Persian control. [ 12 ] However, it became increasingly apparent that the Delian League was really a front for Athenian hegemony throughout the Aegean. [ 13 ] A competing coalition of Greek city-states centred around Sparta arose, and became more important as the external Persian threat subsided. This coalition is known as the Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, this league was not a response to any external threat, Persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at Sparta's security and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese peninsula. [ 14 ] The term \"Peloponnesian League\" is a misnomer. It was not really a \"league\" at all. Nor was it really \"Peloponnesian\".

[ 14 ] The terms \"Spartan League\" and \"Peloponnesian League\" are modern terms. Contemporaries instead referred to \" Lacedaemonians and their Allies\" to describe the \"league\". [ 14 ] The league had its origins in Sparta's conflict with Argos , another city on the Peloponnese Peninsula. In the 7th century BC Argos dominated the peninsula. Even in the early 6th century the Argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the peninsula. The rise of Sparta in the 6th century brought Sparta into conflict with Argos. However, with the conquest of the Peloponnesian city-state of Tegea in 550 BC and the defeat of the Argives in 546 BC the Spartans' control began to reach well beyond the borders of Laconia . The thirty years peace As the two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict. Under the influence of King Archidamus II (the Eurypontid king of Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC [ 15 ] Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones. [ 16 ] Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that war was inevitable. [ 17 ] As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a \"diarchy\" with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. One line of hereditary kings was from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynasty. With the signing of the Thirty Years Peace treaty, Archidamus II felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours.

However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta. [ 19 ] Causes of the Peloponnesian war The immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely Thucydides and Plutarch . Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, Corcyra (modern-day Corfu ), went to war in 435 BC over the new Corcyran colony of Epidamnus . [ 20 ] Sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle. [ 21 ] In 433 BC, Corcyra sought Athenian assistance in the war. Corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of Athens. However, to further encourage Athens to enter the conflict, Corcyra pointed out how useful a friendly relationship with Corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of Corcyra itself and the colony of Epidamnus on the east shore of the Adriatic Sea. [ 22 ] Furthermore, Corcyra promised that Athens would have the use of Corcyra's navy, the third-largest in Greece. This was too good an offer for Athens to refuse. Accordingly, Athens signed a defensive alliance with Corcyra. The next year, in 432 BC, Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia ), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea. [ 23 ] In 434–433 BC Athens issued the \" Megarian Decrees \", a series of decrees that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people.

[ 24 ] The Peloponnesian League accused Athens of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, Sparta formally declared war on Athens. Many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other. The Peloponnesian war: Opening stages (431–421 BC) Sparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica , but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of Pericles . At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnesus, winning battles at Naupactus (429) and Pylos (425). However, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421). The Peloponnesian war: Second phase (418–404 BC) In 418 BC, however, conflict between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of hostilities. Alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the Athenians to ally with Argos against the Spartans. [ 25 ] At the Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. Accordingly, Argos and the rest of the Peloponnesus was brought back under the control of Sparta. [ 25 ] The return of peace allowed Athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the Peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order.

Soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into Athens. [ 25 ] A strong \"peace party\" arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the Athenian Empire . Concentration on the Athenian Empire, however, brought Athens into conflict with another Greek state. Ever since the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens. [ 26 ] In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality. [ 26 ] Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was inclined toward military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the south-west Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League. [ 26 ] This continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the Delian League. The debate between Athens and Melos over the issue of joining the Delian League is presented by Thucydides in his Melian Dialogue . [ 27 ] The debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between Melos and Athens and Melos was invaded in 416 BC, and soon occupied by Athens.

[ 28 ] Accordingly, the people of Athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by Alcibiades . Thus, in 415 BC, Alcibiades found support within the Athenian Assembly for his position when he urged that Athens launch a major expedition against Syracuse , a Peloponnesian ally in Sicily , Magna Graecia . [ 29 ] Segesta, a town in Sicily, had requested Athenian assistance in their war with another Sicilian town—the town of Selinus. Although Nicias was a sceptic about the Sicilian Expedition , he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition. [ 30 ] However, unlike the expedition against Melos, the citizens of Athens were deeply divided over Alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far-off Sicily. In June 415 BC, on the very eve of the departure of the Athenian fleet for Sicily, a band of vandals in Athens defaced the many statues of the god Hermes that were scattered throughout the city of Athens. [ 31 ] This action was blamed on Alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign. [ 32 ] In all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of Hermes was the action of the peace party. [ 33 ] Having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken Alcibiades' hold on the people of Athens. Successfully blaming Alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened Alcibiades and the war party in Athens. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of Hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet. Such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated. Even before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes, prompting Alcibiades to flee to Sparta. [ 34",

Even before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes, prompting Alcibiades to flee to Sparta. [ 34 ] When the fleet later landed in Sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster. The entire expeditionary force was lost and Nicias was captured and executed. This was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of Athens. Meanwhile, Alcibiades betrayed Athens and became a chief advisor to the Spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land. Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time—large enough to challenge the Athenian superiority at sea. Additionally, Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes—the Persians. As noted below, Alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in Sparta when he was accused of having seduced Timaea, the wife of Agis II, the Eurypontid king of Sparta. [ 19 ] Accordingly, Alcibiades was required to flee from Sparta and seek the protection of the Persian Court. In the Persian court, Alcibiades now betrayed both Athens and Sparta. He encouraged Persia to give Sparta financial aid to build a navy, advising that long and continuous warfare between Sparta and Athens would weaken both city-states and allow the Persians to dominate the Greek peninsula. Among the war party in Athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to Sicily in 415–413 could have been avoided if Alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition. Thus, despite his treacherous flight to Sparta and his collaboration with Sparta and later with the Persian court, there arose a demand among the war party that Alcibiades be allowed to return to Athens without being arrested.

Alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the Athenian-controlled island of Samos . Alcibiades felt that \"radical democracy\" was his worst enemy. Accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in Athens. If the coup were successful Alcibiades promised to return to Athens. In 411, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in Athens, by a group which became known as \"the 400\". However, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in Samos failed. Alcibiades was immediately made an admiral ( navarch ) in the Athenian navy. Later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 were replaced by a broader oligarchy called \"the 5000\". Alcibiades did not immediately return to Athens. In early 410, Alcibiades led an Athenian fleet of 18 triremes against the Persian-financed Spartan fleet at Abydos near the Hellespont . The Battle of Abydos had actually begun before the arrival of Alcibiades, and had been inclining slightly toward the Athenians. However, with the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenian victory over the Spartans became a rout. Only the approach of nightfall and the movement of Persian troops to the coast where the Spartans had beached their ships saved the Spartan navy from total destruction. Following Alcibiades' advice, the Persian Empire had been playing Sparta and Athens off against each other. However, as weak as the Spartan navy was after the Battle of Abydos, the Persian navy directly assisted the Spartans. Alcibiades then pursued and met the combined Spartan and Persian fleets at the Battle of Cyzicus later in the spring of 410, achieving a significant victory.

By occupying the Hellespont , the source of Athens' grain imports, Sparta effectively threatened Athens with starvation. [ 35 ] In response, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, but were decisively defeated at Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. Lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the \" Thirty Tyrants \" to govern Athens. Meanwhile, in Sparta, Timaea gave birth to a child. The child was given the name Leotychidas, after the great grandfather of Agis II—King Leotychidas of Sparta. However, because of Timaea's alleged affair with Alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young Leotychidas was fathered by Alcibiades. [ 19 ] Indeed, Agis II refused to acknowledge Leotychidas as his son until he relented, in front of witnesses, on his deathbed in 400 BC. [ 36 ] Upon the death of Agis II, Leotychidas attempted to claim the Eurypontid throne for himself, but this was met with an outcry, led by Lysander, who was at the height of his influence in Sparta. [ 36 ] Lysander argued that Leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the Eurypontid throne; [ 36 ] instead he backed the hereditary claim of Agesilaus, son of Agis by another wife.

[ 37 ] Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and in other cities. In 395 BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. Athens , Argos , Thebes , and Corinth, the latter two former Spartan allies, challenged Sparta's dominance in the Corinthian War , which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked the Greeks by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia. The agreement turned over the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus, reversing a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war in which Thebes allied with its old enemy Athens. Then the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis . In 346 BC the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time.

The sources denounce this Athenian supremacy (or hegemony ) as smothering and disadvantageous. [ note 1 ] After 403 BC, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived. The first of these turnarounds was managed by Athens as early as 390 BC, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory. Spartan hegemony This empire was powerful but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all—of Athens' allies and of Athens itself—and their power was undivided. By the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta. [ 39 ] The subject of how to reorganize the Athenian Empire as part of the Spartan Empire provoked much heated debate among Sparta's full citizens. The admiral Lysander felt that the Spartans should rebuild the Athenian empire in such a way that Sparta profited from it. Lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others. [ 40 ] Prior to this, Spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots (which generally discouraged their accumulation) and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property. Without the Spartans' support, Lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him—on Samos, for example, festivals known as Lysandreia were organized in his honour. He was recalled to Sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters. Sparta refused to see Lysander or his successors dominate. Not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 BC not to support the directives that he had made. Agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century BC.

This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the Spartan state. Agesilaus employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-Hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the Persian empire. [ 41 ] Once again, the Persian empire played both sides against each other. The Persian Court supported Sparta in the rebuilding of their navy while simultaneously funding the Athenians, who used Persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls (destroyed in 404 BC) as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories. For most of the first years of his reign, Agesilaus had been engaged in a war against Persia in the Aegean Sea and in Asia Minor. [ 42 ] In 394 BC, the Spartan authorities ordered Agesilaus to return to mainland Greece. While Agesilaus had a large part of the Spartan Army in Asia Minor, the Spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces led by Corinth. [ 43 ] At the Battle of Haliartus the Spartans had been defeated by the Theban forces. Worse yet, Lysander, Sparta's chief military leader, had been killed during the battle. [ 44 ] This was the start of what became known as the \" Corinthian War \" (395–387 BC). [ 41 ] Upon hearing of the Spartan loss at Haliartus and of the death of Lysander, Agesilaus headed out of Asia Minor, back across the Hellespont, across Thrace and back towards Greece.

[ 45 ] However, when the war descended into guerilla tactics, Sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with Persia. [ 45 ] The long Corinthian War finally ended with the Peace of Antalcidas or the King's Peace , in which the \"Great King\" of Persia, Artaxerxes II , pronounced a \"treaty\" of peace between the various city-states of Greece which broke up all \"leagues\" of city-states on Greek mainland and in the islands of the Aegean Sea . Although this was looked upon as \"independence\" for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral \"treaty\" was highly favourable to the interests of the Persian Empire. The Corinthian War revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in Greece. While Athens and Sparta fought each other to exhaustion, Thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various Greek city-states. In 387 BC, an edict was promulgated by the Persian king, preserving the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Cyprus as well as the independence of the Greek Aegean cities, except for Lymnos, Imbros and Skyros, which were given over to Athens. [ 46 ] It dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones. This is an ultimatum that benefited Athens only to the extent that Athens held onto three islands. While the \"Great King\", Artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, Sparta was to act as Persia's agent in enforcing the Peace. [ 47 ] To the Persians this document is known as the \" King's Peace \". To the Greeks, this document is known as the Peace of Antalcidas , after the Spartan diplomat Antalcidas who was sent to Persia as negotiator.

Accordingly, the \"Peace of Antalcidas\" is not a negotiated peace at all. Rather it is a surrender to the interests of Persia, drafted entirely for its benefit. [ 47 ] On the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences. In accordance with it, the Boeotian League , or Boeotian confederacy, was dissolved in 386 BC. [ 48 ] This confederacy was dominated by Thebes, a city hostile to the Spartan hegemony. Sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in Epirus and in the north of Greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of Thebes, the Cadmea, after an expedition in the Chalcidice and the capture of Olynthos. It was a Theban politician who suggested to the Spartan general Phoibidas that Sparta should seize Thebes itself. This act was sharply condemned, though Sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by Phoibidas. The Spartan attack was successful and Thebes was placed under Spartan control. [ 49 ] In 378 BC, the reaction to Spartan control over Thebes was broken by a popular uprising within Thebes. Elsewhere in Greece, the reaction against Spartan hegemony began when Sphodrias, another Spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on Piraeus . [ 50 ] Although the gates of Piraeus were no longer fortified, Sphodrias was driven off before Piraeus. Back in Sparta, Sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the Spartan court. Nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between Athens and Thebes.

The rising spirit of rebellion against Sparta also fueled Thebes' attempt to restore the former Boeotian confederacy. [ 51 ] In Boeotia , the Theban leaders Pelopidas and Epaminondas reorganized the Theban army and began to free the towns of Boeotia from their Spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived Boeotian League. [ 47 ] Pelopidas won a great victory for Thebes over a much larger Spartan force in the Battle of Tegyra in 375 BC. [ 52 ] Theban authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that Athens came to mistrust the growing Theban power. Athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second Athenian League. [ 53 ] Attention was drawn to growing power of Thebes when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, Phocis , and, particularly, after Thebes razed the city of Plataea , a long-standing ally of Athens, in 375 BC. [ 54 ] The destruction of Plataea caused Athens to negotiate an alliance with Sparta against Thebes, in that same year.

Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens—unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league—but to the Athenian generals themselves. The Athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the eisphora . They reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the Proseiphora , in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors. This system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy . This league responded to a real and present need. On the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century BC, with Athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league. Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained. The main reasons for the eventual failure were structural. This alliance was only valued out of fear of Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'. The Athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360 BC, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364 BC) decided to secede.

Athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy, thereby weakening itself more and more, and signaling the end of Athenian hegemony. Theban hegemony – tentative and with no future This was not Thebes' first attempt at hegemony. It had been the most important city of Boeotia and the centre of the previous Boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386. The 5th-century confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus and known as \"the Anonyme of Thebes\". Thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy. Citizenship was defined according to wealth, and Thebes counted 11,000 active citizens. The confederacy was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a \" boeotarch \", a certain number of council members, 1,000 hoplites and 100 horsemen. From the 5th century BC the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders. It also had a small fleet that played a part in the Peloponnesian War by providing 25 triremes for the Spartans. At the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a \"navarch\".

This dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the Thebans (who had lost the Cadmea to Sparta in 382 BC) from reforming this confederacy. Pelopidas and Epaminondas endowed Thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of Athens, the Thebans revived the title of \"Boeotarch\" lost in the Persian King's Peace and—with victory at Leuctra and the destruction of Spartan power—the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy. Epaminondas rid the Peloponnesus of pro-Spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-Theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by Sparta. He equally supported the reconstruction of the city of Messene thanks to an invasion of Laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them Messene as a capital. He decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the Peloponnessus, forming an Arcadian confederacy (the King's Peace had destroyed a previous Arcadian confederacy and put Messene under Spartan control). The strength of the Boeotian League explains Athens' problems with her allies in the second Athenian League. Epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the Athenian league and joining a Boeotian maritime league. Epaminondas and Pelopidas also reformed the army of Thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting. Thus, the Theban army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other Greek states at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC. Sparta also remained an important power in the face of Theban strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In ",

Sparta also remained an important power in the face of Theban strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In 367 BC, both Sparta and Athens sent delegates to Artaxerxes II, the Great King of Persia. These delegates sought to have the Artaxerxes, once again, declare Greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 BC. As noted above, this had meant the destruction of the Boeotian League in 387 BC. Sparta and Athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar \"Kings Peace\". Thebes sent Pelopidas to argue against them. [ 55 ] The Great King was convinced by Pelopidas and the Theban diplomats that Thebes and the Boeotian League would be the best agents of Persian interests in Greece, and, accordingly, did not issue a new \"King's Peace\". [ 48 ] Thus, to deal with Thebes, Athens and Sparta were thrown back on their own resources. Thebes, meanwhile, expanded its influence beyond the bounds of Boeotia. In 364 BC, Pelopidas defeated the Alexander of Pherae in the Battle of Cynoscephalae , located in south-eastern Thessaly in northern Greece. However, during the battle, Pelopides was killed. [ 56 ] The confederational framework of Sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea , which re-allied in the Arcadian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians, and the Tegeans that of the Thebans.

Despite the victory at Mantinea , in the end, the Thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the Peloponnesus. This event is looked upon as a watershed in Greek history. Thus, Xenophon concludes his history of the Greek world at this point, in 362 BC. The end of this period was even more confused than its beginning. Greece had failed and, according to Xenophon, the history of the Greek world was no longer intelligible. The idea of hegemony disappeared. From 362 BC onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in Greece. The Spartans were greatly weakened; the Athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; Thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat Sparta and Athens but not to be a major power in Asia Minor. Other forces also intervened, such as the Persian king, who appointed himself arbitrator among the Greek cities, with their tacit agreement. This situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for them. One war led to another, each longer and more bloody than the last, and the cycle could not be broken. Hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the invasion of Laconia in 370 BC. Rise of Macedon Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC.

Rise of Macedon Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC. The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Philip of Macedon was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas . Within a short time, Philip was acclaimed king as Philip II of Macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs. [ 57 ] During his lifetime, Philip II consolidated his rule over Macedonia. This was done by 359 BC and Philip began to look toward expanding Macedonia's influence abroad. Under Philip II , (359–336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians , Thracians , and Illyrians . [ 58 ] In 358 BC, Philip allied with Epirus in its campaign against Illyria. In 357 BC, Philip came into direct conflict with Athens when he conquered the Thracian port city of Amphipolis , a city located at the mouth of the Strymon River to the east of Macedonia, and a major Athenian trading port. Conquering this city allowed Philip to subjugate all of Thrace. A year later in 356 BC, the Macedonians attacked and conquered the Athenian-controlled port city of Pydna . This brought the Macedonian threat to Athens closer to home to the Athenians. With the start of the Phocian War in 356 BC, the great Athenian orator and political leader of the \"war party\", Demosthenes , became increasingly active in encouraging Athens to fight vigorously against Philip's expansionist aims. [ 59 ] In 352 BC, Demosthenes gave many speeches against the Macedonian threat, declaring Philip II Athens' greatest enemy. The leader of the Athenian \"peace party\" was Phocion , who wished to avoid a confrontation that, Phocion felt, would be catastrophic for Athens. Despite Phocion's attempts to restrain the war party, Athens remained at war with Macedonia for years following the original declaration of war. [ 60 ] Negotiations between Athens and Philip II started only in 346 BC. [ 61 ] The Athenians successfully halted Philip's invasion of Attica at Thermopylae that same year in",

However, Philip defeated the Phocians at the Battle of the Crocus Field . The conflict between Macedonia and a coalition of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes came to a head in 338 BC, [ 62 ] at the Battle of Chaeronea . The Macedonians became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Greece, but also retained more archaic aspects harking back to the palace culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella , resembling Mycenaean culture more than that of the Classical city-states. Militarily, Philip recognized the new phalanx style of fighting that had been employed by Epaminondas and Pelopidas in Thebes. Accordingly, he incorporated this new system into the Macedonian army. Philip II also brought a Theban military tutor to Macedon to instruct the future Alexander the Great in the Theban method of fighting. [ 63 ] Philip's son Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) was born in Pella , Macedonia. Philip II brought Aristotle to Pella to teach the young Alexander. [ 64 ] Besides Alexander's mother, Olympias, Philip took another wife by the name of Cleopatra Eurydice . [ 65 ] Cleopatra had a daughter, Europa, and a son, Caranus . Caranus posed a threat to the succession of Alexander. [ 66 ] Cleopatra Eurydice was a Macedonian and, thus, Caranus was all Macedonian in blood. Olympias, on the other hand, was from Epirus and, thus, Alexander was regarded as being only half-Macedonian (Cleopatra Eurydice should not be confused with Cleopatra of Macedon , who was Alexander's full-sister and thus daughter of Philip and Olympias).

Philip II was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra of Macedon with King Alexander I of Epirus in 336 BC. [ 67 ] Philip's son, the future Alexander the Great , immediately claimed the throne of Macedonia by eliminating all the other claimants to the throne, including Caranus and his cousin Amytas. [ 68 ] Alexander was only twenty years of age when he assumed the throne. [ 69 ] Thereafter, Alexander continued his father's plans to conquer all of Greece. He did this by both military might and persuasion. After his victory over Thebes, Alexander traveled to Athens to meet the public directly. Despite Demosthenes ' speeches against the Macedonian threat on behalf of the war party of Athens, the public in Athens was still very much divided between the \"peace party\" and Demosthenes' \"war party\". However, the arrival of Alexander charmed the Athenian public. [ 70 ] The peace party was strengthened and then a peace between Athens and Macedonia was agreed. [ 71 ] This allowed Alexander to move on his and the Greeks' long-held dream of conquest in the east, with a unified and secure Greek state at his back. In 334 BC, Alexander with about 30,000 infantry soldiers and 5,000 cavalry crossed the Hellespont into Asia. He never returned. [ 72 ] Alexander managed to briefly extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states, but also to the Persian empire , including Egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of India .

Legacy of classical Greece The legacy of Greece was strongly felt by post-Renaissance European elite, who saw themselves as the spiritual heirs of Greece. Will Durant wrote in 1939 that \"excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that does not come from Greece,\" and conversely \"there is nothing in Greek civilization that doesn't illuminate our own\". [ 76 ] See also Classical antiquity Classics Art in ancient Greece Greece Notes ^ These sources include Xenophon's continuation of Thucydides' work in his Hellenica, which provided a continuous narrative of Greek history up to 362 BC but has defects, such as bias towards Sparta, with whose king Agesilas Xenophon lived for a while. We also have Plutarch, a 2nd-century Boeotian, whose Life of Pelopidas gives a Theban version of events and Diodorus Siculus. This is also the era where the epigraphic evidence develops, a source of the highest importance for this period, both for Athens and for a number of continental Greek cities that also issued decrees.

    "text": "The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke . [ 1 ] It is about a traveler (implicitly understood to be Jewish) who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. A Jewish priest and then a Levite come by, both avoiding the man. A Samaritan happens upon him and—though Samaritans and Jews were generally antagonistic toward each other—helps him. Jesus tells the parable in response to a provocative question from a lawyer in the context of the Great Commandment : \"And who is my neighbour?\" [ 1 ] The conclusion is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to their fellow man or woman. Some Christians, such as Augustine , have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul. [ 2 ] Others discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable's original meaning [ 2 ] and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus. [ 3 ] The parable has inspired painting, sculpture, satire, poetry, photography, film, and many others. The phrase \" Good Samaritan \", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many hospitals and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan. Narrative In Luke 10 , the parable is introduced by a question, known as the Great Commandment : Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" He said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\" He answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\" He said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\" But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\" — Luke 10:25–29, World English Bible [ 4 ] Jesus replies with a story: Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side",

By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan , as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii , gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\" He said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\" Then Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\" — Luke 10:30–37, World English Bible [ 5 ] Historical context Road from Jerusalem to Jericho In the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers who robbed people\". [ 6 ] Martin Luther King Jr. , on the day before his assassination , described the road as follows: I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles—or rather 1,200 feet (370 m) above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you",

That's a dangerous road. — Martin Luther King Jr., \" I've Been to the Mountaintop \" (April 3, 1968) Samaritans and Jesus While relations between Jews and Samaritans as closely related ethnoreligious groups in the region are historically complex and not purely negative, a distinct downturn occurred in the late 2nd century BCE during the Hasmonean dynasty , which involved the destruction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim in 128 BCE. [ 7 ] In the early 1st century CE, Samaritans had desecrated the Jewish Temple at Passover with human bones. [ 8 ] Due to this hatred, some think that the lawyer's phrase \"The one who had mercy on him\" (Luke 10:37) [ 9 ] may indicate a reluctance to name the Samaritan. [ 10 ] Or, on another, more positive note, it may indicate that the lawyer has recognized that both his questions have been answered and now concludes by generally expressing that anyone behaving thus is a (Leviticus 19:18) [ 11 ] \"neighbor\" eligible to inherit eternal life. [ a ] As the story reached those who were unaware of its context—i.e., the oppression of the Samaritans, and the bitter hatred that Jesus' listeners and Samaritans had for each other—this aspect of the parable received less and less recognition; uninformed people saw \"Samaritan\" as merely a convenient name for that individual, when in fact it stood for \"hated outsider who worships falsely and desecrates our religion\" [ dubious – discuss ] .

Today, to remedy this missing context, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] For example, anti-slavery campaigner William Jay described clergy who ignored slavery as \"following the example of the priest and Levite\". [ 14 ] Martin Luther King Jr. , in his April 1968 \" I've Been to the Mountaintop \" speech, described the Samaritan as \"a man of another race\". [ 15 ] Sundee Tucker Frazier saw the Samaritan more specifically as an example of a \" mixed-race \" person. [ 16 ] Klyne Snodgrass wrote: \"On the basis of this parable we must deal with our own racism but must also seek justice for, and offer assistance to, those in need, regardless of the group to which they belong.\" [ 17 ] Samaritans appear elsewhere in the Gospels and the Book of Acts. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus heals ten lepers and only the Samaritan among them thanks him, [ 18 ] [ 8 ] although Luke 9:51–56 [ 19 ] depicts Jesus receiving a hostile reception in Samaria. [ 20 ] Luke's favorable treatment of Samaritans is in line with the favorable treatment elsewhere in the book of the weak and of outcasts, generally.

[ 25 ] Many see 2 Chronicles 28 :8–15 [ 26 ] as the model for the Samaritan's neighborly behavior in the parable. In Chronicles, Northern Israelite ancestors of Samaritans treat Judean enemies as fellow-Israelite neighbors. [ b ] After comparing the earlier account with the later parable presented to the expert in Israel's religious law, one could conclude: \"Given the number and significance of these parallels and points of correspondence it is hard to imagine how a first-century scholar of Scripture could hear the parable and not think of the story of the merciful Samaritans of 2 Chronicles 28.\" [ 27 ] Priests and Levites In Jewish culture, contact with a dead body was understood to be defiling. [ 8 ] Priests were particularly enjoined to avoid uncleanness. [ 8 ] The priest and Levite may therefore have assumed that the fallen traveler was dead and avoided him to keep themselves ritually clean. [ 8 ] On the other hand, the depiction of travel downhill (from Jerusalem to Jericho) may indicate that their temple duties had already been completed, making this explanation less likely, [ 28 ] although this is disputed. [ 20 ] Since the Mishnah made an exception for neglected corpses, [ 20 ] the priest and the Levite could have used the law to justify both touching a corpse or ignoring it. [ 20 ] In any case, passing by on the other side avoided checking \"whether he was dead or alive\".

Jerusalem is paradise, and Jericho is the world. The robbers are hostile powers. The priest is the Law , the Levite is the prophets , and the Samaritan is Christ. The wounds are disobedience, the beast is the Lord's body, the [inn], which accepts all who wish to enter, is the Church .

And the fact that the Samaritan promises he will return represents the Savior's second coming . — Origen 1996 , p. 136, Homily 34, para 3 John Welch further states: This allegorical reading was taught not only by ancient followers of Jesus, but it was virtually universal throughout early Christianity, being advocated by Irenaeus , Clement , and Origen , and in the fourth and fifth centuries by Chrysostom in Constantinople, Ambrose in Milan, and Augustine in North Africa. This interpretation is found most completely in two other medieval stained-glass windows, in the French cathedrals at Bourges and Sens .\" — Welch 2007 , pp. 26–33 The allegorical interpretation is also traditional in the Eastern Orthodox Church . [ 30 ] John Newton refers to the allegorical interpretation in his hymn \"How Kind the Good Samaritan\", which begins: How kind the good Samaritan To him who fell among the thieves! Thus Jesus pities fallen man, And heals the wounds the soul receives. [ 31 ] Robert Funk also suggests that Jesus' Jewish listeners were to identify with the robbed and wounded man.

[ 32 ] Ethical reading John Calvin was not impressed by Origen 's allegorical reading: The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice (John 5:25). [ 33 ] As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ. — Calvin 1845 , p. 54 The meaning of the parable for Calvin was, instead, that \"compassion, which an enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man.

Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.\" [ 34 ] In other writings, Calvin pointed out that people are not born merely for themselves, but rather \"mankind is knit together with a holy knot [...] we must not live for ourselves, but for our neighbors.\" [ 35 ] Earlier, Cyril of Alexandria had written that \"a crown of love is being twined for him who loves his neighbour.\" [ 36 ] Francis Schaeffer suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen. That is ugly. We are to have the example of the good Samaritan consciously in mind at all times.\" [ 37 ] Other modern theologians have taken similar positions. For example, G. B. Caird wrote: Dodd quotes as a cautionary example Augustine 's allegorisation of the Good Samaritan, in which the man is Adam, Jerusalem the heavenly city, Jericho the moon – the symbol of immortality; the thieves are the devil and his angels, who strip the man of immortality by persuading him to sin and so leave him (spiritually) half dead; the priest and Levite represent the Old Testament, the Samaritan Christ, the beast his flesh which he assumed at the Incarnation; the inn is the church and the innkeeper the apostle Paul. Most modern readers would agree with Dodd that this farrago bears no relationship to the real meaning of the parable. — Caird 1980 , p. 165 Joel B. Green writes that Jesus' final question (which, in something of a \"twist\", [ 38 ] reverses the question originally asked): [The question] presupposes the identification of \"anyone\" as a neighbor, then presses the point that such an identification opens wide the door of loving action.

By leaving aside the identity of the wounded man and by portraying the Samaritan traveler as one who performs the law (and so as one whose actions are consistent with an orientation to eternal life), Jesus has nullified the worldview that gives rise to such questions as, Who is my neighbor? The purity-holiness matrix has been capsized. And, not surprisingly in the Third Gospel, neighborly love has been concretized in care for one who is, in this parable, self-evidently a social outcast — Green 1997 , p. 432 Such a reading of the parable makes it important in liberation theology , [ 39 ] where it provides a concrete anchoring for love [ 40 ] and indicates an \"all embracing reach of solidarity.\" [ 41 ] In Indian Dalit theology , it is seen as providing a \"life-giving message to the marginalized Dalits and a challenging message to the non-Dalits.\" [ 42 ] Martin Luther King Jr. often spoke of this parable, contrasting the rapacious philosophy of the robbers, and the self-preserving non-involvement of the priest and Levite, with the Samaritan's coming to the aid of the man in need. [ 43 ] King also extended the call for neighborly assistance to society at large: On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway.

Sin and the devil are the robbers who have despoiled man of his robe of innocence and all supernatural gifts, and grievously wounded him in his natural gifts. Thus man lay, weak, helpless, and half-dead. He still, it is true, possessed his natural life, but he had lost the supernatural life of grace, as well as the prospect of eternal life, and was powerless to raise himself from the misery of sin by any effort of his own. Neither priest nor Levite, i. e. neither sacrifice nor law of the Old Covenant, could help him, or heal his wounds; they only made him realize more fully his helpless condition. Then the Son of God, moved by compassion, came down from heaven to help poor fallen man, living at enmity with God. He healed his wounds with the wine of His Most Precious Blood and the oil of His grace, and took him to the inn, His Church. When He left this earth to return to heaven, He gave to the guardians of His Church the twofold treasure of His doctrine and His grace, and ordered them to tend the still weak man, until He Himself came back to reward every one according to his works.

[ 45 ] Other interpretations In addition to these classical interpretations many scholars have drawn additional themes from the story. Some have suggested that religious tolerance was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Others have suggested that Jesus was attempting to convey an anti-establishment message, not necessarily in the sense of rejecting authority figures in general, but in the sense of rejecting religious hypocrisy. By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or the importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] The story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25–37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor\", possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews—i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite\", no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of love. The term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers. [ c ] In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is",

Abraham ibn Ḥayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; Ḥayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are Ḳedushah\", i. 5; and Moses Ḥagis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit\", p. 258.

[ 20 ] Bernard Brandon Scott, a member of the Jesus Seminar, questions the authenticity of the parable's context, suggesting that \"the parable originally circulated separately from the question about neighborliness\" [ 54 ] and that the \"existence of the lawyer's question in Mark 12:28–34 [ 55 ] and Matthew 22:34–40, [ 56 ] in addition to the evidence of heavy Lukan editing\" [ 54 ] indicates the parable and its context were \"very probably joined editorially by Luke.\" [ 54 ] A number of other commentators share this opinion, [ 57 ] with the consensus of the Jesus Seminar being that verses Luke 10:36–37 [ 58 ] were added by Luke to \"connect with the lawyer's question.\" [ 52 ] On the other hand, the \"keen rabbinic interest in the question of the greatest commandment \" [ 57 ] may make this argument invalid, in that Luke may be describing a different occurrence of the question being asked. [ 57 ] Differences between the gospels suggest that Luke is referring to a different episode from Mark and Matthew, [ 59 ] and Klyne Snodgrass writes that \"While one cannot exclude that Luke has joined two originally separate narratives, evidence for this is not convincing.\" [ 59 ] The Oxford Bible Commentary notes: That Jesus was only tested once in this way is not a necessary assumption. The twist between the lawyer's question and Jesus' answer is entirely in keeping with Jesus' radical stance: he was making the lawyer rethink his presuppositions. — Barton & Muddiman 2001 , p. 942 The unexpected appearance of the Samaritan led Joseph Halévy to suggest that the parable originally involved \"a priest, a Levite, and an Israelite\", [ 53 ] in line with contemporary Jewish stories, and that Luke changed the parable to be more familiar to a gentile audience.\" [ 53 ]",

[ 10 ] William C. Placher points out that such debate misinterprets the biblical genre of a parable, which illustrates a moral rather than a historical point: on reading the story, \"we are not inclined to check the story against the police blotter for the Jerusalem-Jericho highway patrol. We recognize that Jesus is telling a story to illustrate a moral point, and that such stories often don't claim to correspond to actual events.\" [ 60 ] The traditionally understood ethical moral of the story would not hold if the parable originally followed the priest-Levite-Israelite sequence of contemporary Jewish stories, as Halévy suggested, for then it would deal strictly with intra-Israelite relations just as did the Lev 19:18 command under discussion. As a metaphor and name The term \"good Samaritan\" is used as a common metaphor: \"The word now applies to any charitable person, especially one who, like the man in the parable, rescues or helps out a needy stranger.\" [ 61 ] The name has consequently been used for a number of charitable organizations, including Samaritans , Samaritan's Purse , Sisters of the Good Samaritan , and The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong . The name Good Samaritan Hospital is used for a number of hospitals around the world. Good Samaritan laws protect those who choose to serve and tend to others who are injured or ill.

[ 64 ] In some Eastern Orthodox icons of the parable, the identification of the Good Samaritan as Christ is made explicit with a halo bearing a cross. [ 65 ] The numerous later artistic depictions of the parable include those of Rembrandt , Jan Wijnants , Vincent van Gogh , Aimé Morot , Domenico Fetti , Johann Carl Loth , George Frederic Watts , and Giacomo Conti . Vincent van Gogh's painting captures the reverse hierarchy that is underscored in Luke's parable. Although the priest and Levite are near the top of the status hierarchy in Israel and the Samaritans near the bottom, van Gogh reverses this hierarchy in the painting. In his essay Lost in Non-Translation , biochemist and author Isaac Asimov argues that to the Jews of the time there were no good Samaritans; in his view, this was half the point of the parable. As Asimov put it, we need to think of the story occurring in Alabama in 1950, with a mayor and a preacher ignoring a man who has been beaten and robbed, with the role of the Samaritan being played by a poor black sharecropper. The story's theme is portrayed throughout Marvel's Daredevil . [ 66 ] The parable of the Good Samaritan is the theme for the Austrian Christian Charity commemorative coin , minted 12 March 2003. This coin shows the Good Samaritan with the wounded man, on his horse, as he takes him to an inn for medical attention. An older coin with this theme is the American \"Good Samaritan Shilling\" of 1652. [ 67 ] Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a poem on the parable (\"The Good Samaritan\"), of which the third stanza reads: He's been a fool, perhaps, and would Have prospered had he tried, But he was one who never could Pass by the other side.

    "text": " the wounded man, on his horse, as he takes him to an inn for medical attention. An older coin with this theme is the American \"Good Samaritan Shilling\" of 1652. [ 67 ] Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a poem on the parable (\"The Good Samaritan\"), of which the third stanza reads: He's been a fool, perhaps, and would Have prospered had he tried, But he was one who never could Pass by the other side. An honest man whom men called soft, While laughing in their sleeves— No doubt in business ways he oft Had fallen amongst thieves. — The Good Samaritan, Lawson 1906 , p. 132 John Gardiner Calkins Brainard also wrote a poem on the theme. [ 68 ] Dramatic film adaptations of the Parable of the Good Samaritan include the short film Samaritan (2006), set in a modern context, per the literary device of the Modern Parables DVD Bible study series. [ 69 ] The English composer, Benjamin Britten , was commissioned to write a piece to mark the centenary of the Red Cross . His resulting work for solo voices, choir, and orchestra, Cantata Misericordium , sets a Latin text by Patrick Wilkinson that tells the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was first performed in Geneva in 1963. In a real-life psychology experiment sometime before 1973, a number of seminary students – in a rush to teach on this parable – failed to stop to help a shabbily dressed person on the side of the road. [ 70 ] The Good Samaritan by Rembrandt (1630) shows the Good Samaritan making arrangements with the innkeeper. A later (1633) print by Rembrandt has a reversed and somewhat expanded version of the scene.

This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Leviticus 19:18 ( Luke 10:29 ).

It is thus a term that broadly spans approximately 2,206 years, during which the force underwent numerous permutations in size , composition , organization , equipment and tactics , while conserving a core of lasting traditions. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Early Roman army (c. 550 – c. 300 BC) Until c. 550 BC , there was no \"national\" Roman army, but a series of clan-based war-bands which only coalesced into a united force in periods of serious external threat. Around 550 BC, during the period conventionally known as the rule of king Servius Tullius , it appears that a universal levy of eligible adult male citizens was instituted. This development apparently coincided with the introduction of heavy armour for most of the infantry. Although originally low in numbers, the Roman infantry was extremely effective and developed some influential battle strategies. The early Roman army was based on a compulsory levy from adult male citizens which was held at the start of each campaigning season, in those years that war was declared. There were no standing or professional forces. During the regal period (to c. 500 BC), the standard levy was probably of 9,000 men, consisting of 6,000 heavily armed infantry (probably Greek-style hoplites ), plus 2,400 light-armed infantry ( rorarii , later called velites ) and 600 light cavalry ( equites celeres ). When the kings were replaced by two annually elected praetores in c. 500 BC, the standard levy remained of the same size, but was now divided equally between the praetors, each commanding one legion of 4,500 men. It is likely that the hoplite element was deployed in a Greek-style phalanx formation in large set-piece battles . However, these were relatively rare, with most fighting consisting of small-scale border-raids and skirmishing. In these, the Romans would fight in their basic tactical unit, the cent",

However, these were relatively rare, with most fighting consisting of small-scale border-raids and skirmishing. In these, the Romans would fight in their basic tactical unit, the centuria of 100 men. In addition, separate clan-based forces remained in existence until c. 450 BC at least, although they would operate under the Praetors' authority, at least nominally. In 493 BC, shortly after the establishment of the Roman Republic , Rome concluded a perpetual treaty of military alliance (the Foedus Cassianum ), with the combined other Latin city-states. The treaty, probably motivated by the need for the Latins to deploy a united defence against incursions by neighbouring hill-tribes, provided for each party to provide an equal force for campaigns under unified command. It remained in force until 358 BC. Roman army of the mid-Republic (c. 300 – 107 BC) The central feature of the Roman army of the mid-Republic , or the Polybian army, was the manipular organization of its battle-line. Instead of a single, large mass (the phalanx ) as in the Early Roman army , the Romans now drew up in three lines consisting of small units (maniples) of 120 men, arrayed in chessboard fashion, giving much greater tactical strength and flexibility. This structure was probably introduced in c. 300 BC during the Samnite Wars . Also probably dating from this period was the regular accompaniment of each legion by a non-citizen formation of roughly equal size, the ala , recruited from Rome's Italian allies, or socii . The latter were approximately 150 autonomous states which were bound by a treaty of perpetual military alliance with Rome. Their sole obligation was to supply to the Roman army, on demand, a number of fully equipped troops up to a specified maximum each year. The Second Punic War (218–201 BC) saw the addition of a third element to the existing dual Roman/Italian structure: non-Italian mercenaries with specialist skills lacking in the legions and alae : Numidian light cavalry , Cretan archers , and Balearic sl",

The Second Punic War (218–201 BC) saw the addition of a third element to the existing dual Roman/Italian structure: non-Italian mercenaries with specialist skills lacking in the legions and alae : Numidian light cavalry , Cretan archers , and Balearic slingers . From this time, these units always accompanied Roman armies. The Republican army of this period, like its earlier forebear, did not maintain standing or professional military forces, but levied them, by compulsory conscription, as required for each campaigning season and disbanded thereafter (although formations could be kept in being over winter during major wars). The standard levy was doubled during the Samnite Wars to four legions (two per consul), for a total of c. 18,000 Roman troops and four allied alae of similar size. Service in the legions was limited to property-owning Roman citizens, normally those known as iuniores (age 16–46). The army's senior officers, including its commanders-in-chief, the Roman consuls, were all elected annually at the People's Assembly. Only equites (members of the Roman knightly order) were eligible to serve as senior officers. Iuniores of the highest social classes ( equites and the First Class of commoners) provided the legion's cavalry, the other classes the legionary infantry. The proletarii (those assessed at under 400 drachmae wealth) were ineligible for legionary service and were assigned to the fleets as oarsmen. Elders, vagrants, freedmen, slaves and convicts were excluded from the military levy, save in emergencies. The legionary cavalry also changed, probably around 300 BC onwards from the light, unarmoured horse of the early army to a heavy force with metal armour (bronze cuirasses and, later, chain-mail shirts). Contrary to a long-held view, the cavalry of the mid-Republic was a highly effective force that generally prevailed against strong enemy cavalry forces (both Gallic and Greek) until it was decisively beaten by the Carthaginian general Hannibal 's horsemen during the Second Punic War.

Contrary to a long-held view, the cavalry of the mid-Republic was a highly effective force that generally prevailed against strong enemy cavalry forces (both Gallic and Greek) until it was decisively beaten by the Carthaginian general Hannibal 's horsemen during the Second Punic War. This was due to Hannibal's greater operational flexibility owing to his Numidian light cavalry. The Polybian army's operations during its existence can be divided into three broad phases. (1) The struggle for hegemony over Italy, especially against the Samnite League (338–264 BC); (2) the struggle with Carthage for hegemony in the western Mediterranean Sea (264–201 BC); and (3) the struggle against the Hellenistic monarchies for control of the eastern Mediterranean (201–91 BC). During the earlier phase, the normal size of the levy (including allies) was in the region of 40,000 men (two consular armies of c. 20,000 men each). During the latter phase, with lengthy wars of conquest followed by permanent military occupation of overseas provinces, the character of the army necessarily changed from a temporary force based entirely on short-term conscription to a standing army in which the conscripts, whose service was in this period limited by law to six consecutive years, were complemented by large numbers of volunteers who were willing to serve for much longer periods. Many of the volunteers were drawn from the poorest social class, which until the Second Punic War had been excluded from service in the legions by the minimum property requirement: during that war, extreme manpower needs had forced the army to ignore the requirement, and this practice continued thereafter. Maniples were gradually phased out as the main tactical unit, and replaced by the larger cohorts used in the allied alae , a process probably complete by the time the general Marius assumed command in 107 BC. (The so-called \" Marian reforms \" of the army hypothesised by some scholars are today seen by other scholars as having evolved earlier and more gradually.)

In the period after the defeat of Carthage in 201 BC, the army was campaigning exclusively outside Italy, resulting in its men being away from their home plots of land for many years at a stretch. They were assuaged by the large amounts of booty that they shared after victories in the rich eastern theatre. But in Italy, the ever-increasing concentration of public lands in the hands of big landowners, and the consequent displacement of the soldiers' families, led to great unrest and demands for land redistribution. This was successfully achieved, but resulted in the disaffection of Rome's Italian allies, who as non-citizens were excluded from the redistribution. This led to the mass revolt of the socii and the Social War (91-88 BC). The result was the grant of Roman citizenship to all Italians and the end of the Polybian army's dual structure: the alae were abolished and the socii recruited into the legions. Imperial Roman army (30 BC – AD 284) Under the founder–emperor Augustus (ruled 30 BC – 14 AD), the legions , c. 5,000-strong all-heavy infantry formations recruited from Roman citizens only, were transformed from a mixed conscript and volunteer corps serving an average of 10 years, to all-volunteer units of long-term professionals serving a standard 25-year term (conscription was only decreed in emergencies). In the later 1st century, the size of a legion's First Cohort was doubled, increasing legionary personnel to c. 5,500. Alongside the legions, Augustus established the auxilia , a regular corps of similar numbers to the legions, recruited from the peregrini (non-citizen inhabitants of the empire – about 90% of the empire's population in the 1st century). As well as comprising large numbers of extra heavy infantry equipped in a similar manner to legionaries, the auxilia provided virtually all the army's cavalry (heavy and light), light infantry, archers and other specialists . The auxilia were organised in c. 500-strong units called cohortes (all-infantry), alae (all-cavalry) and cohortes equitatae (infantry with a",

The auxilia were organised in c. 500-strong units called cohortes (all-infantry), alae (all-cavalry) and cohortes equitatae (infantry with a cavalry contingent attached). Around 80 AD, a minority of auxiliary regiments were doubled in size. Until about 68 AD, the auxilia were recruited by a mix of conscription and voluntary enlistment. After that time, the auxilia became largely a volunteer corps, with conscription resorted to only in emergencies. Auxiliaries were required to serve a minimum of 25 years, although many served for longer periods. On completion of their minimum term, auxiliaries were awarded Roman citizenship, which carried important legal, fiscal and social advantages. Alongside the regular forces, the army of the Principate employed allied native units (called numeri ) from outside the empire on a mercenary basis. These were led by their own aristocrats and equipped in traditional fashion. Numbers fluctuated according to circumstances and are largely unknown. As all-citizen formations, and symbolic guarantors of the dominance of the Italian hegemony, [ citation needed ] legions enjoyed greater social prestige than the auxilia. This was reflected in better pay and benefits. In addition, legionaries were equipped with more expensive and protective armour than auxiliaries. However, in 212, the emperor Caracalla granted Roman citizenship to all the empire's inhabitants. At this point, the distinction between legions and auxilia became moot, the latter becoming all-citizen units also. The change was reflected in the disappearance, during the 3rd century, of legionaries' special equipment, and the progressive break-up of legions into cohort-sized units like the auxilia. By the end of Augustus' reign, the imperial army numbered some 250,000 men, equally split between legionaries and auxiliaries (25 legions and c. 250 auxiliary regiments). The numbers grew to a peak of about 450,000 by 211 (33 legions and c. 400 auxiliary regiments). By then, auxiliaries outnumbered legionaries substantially. From the peak, numbers",

The numbers grew to a peak of about 450,000 by 211 (33 legions and c. 400 auxiliary regiments). By then, auxiliaries outnumbered legionaries substantially. From the peak, numbers probably underwent a steep decline by 270 due to plague and losses during multiple major barbarian invasions. Numbers were restored to their early 2nd-century level of c. 400,000 (but probably not to their 211 peak) under Diocletian (r. 284–305). After the empire's borders became settled (on the Rhine - Danube line in Europe) by 68, virtually all military units (except the Praetorian Guard ) were stationed on or near the borders, in roughly 17 of the 42 provinces of the empire in the reign of Hadrian (r. 117–138). The military chain of command was relatively uniform across the Empire. In each province, the deployed legions' legati (legion commanders, who also controlled the auxiliary regiments attached to their legion) reported to the legatus Augusti pro praetore (provincial governor), who also headed the civil administration. The governor in turn reported directly to the emperor in Rome. There was no army general staff in Rome, but the leading praefectus praetorio (commander of the Praetorian Guard ) often acted as the emperor's de facto military chief-of-staff. Legionary rankers were relatively well-paid, compared to contemporary common labourers. Compared with their subsistence-level peasant families, they enjoyed considerable disposable income, enhanced by periodic cash bonuses on special occasions such as the accession of a new emperor. In addition, on completion of their term of service, they were given a generous discharge bonus equivalent to 13 years' salary. Auxiliaries were paid much less in the early 1st century, but by 100 AD, the differential had virtually disappeared.

Similarly, in the earlier period, auxiliaries appear not to have received cash and discharge bonuses, but probably did so from Hadrian onwards. Junior officers ( principales ), the equivalent of non-commissioned officers in modern armies, could expect to earn up to twice basic pay. Legionary centurions , the equivalent of mid-level commissioned officers, were organised in an elaborate hierarchy. Usually risen from the ranks, they commanded the legion's tactical sub-units of centuriae (c. 80 men) and cohorts (c. 480 men). They were paid several multiples of basic pay. The most senior centurion, the primus pilus , was elevated to equestrian rank upon completion of his single-year term of office. The senior officers of the army, the legati legionis (legion commanders), tribuni militum (legion staff officers) and the praefecti (commanders of auxiliary regiments) were all of at least equestrian rank. In the 1st and early 2nd centuries, they were mainly Italian aristocrats performing the military component of their cursus honorum (conventional career path). Later, provincial career officers became predominant. Senior officers were paid very high salaries, multiples of at least 50 times basic. A typical Roman army during this period consisted of five to six legions. One legion was made up of ten cohorts. The first cohort had five centuria each of 160 soldiers. In the second through tenth cohorts there were six centuria of 80 men each. These do not include archers, cavalry or officers. Soldiers spent only a fraction of their lives on campaign. Most of their time was spent on routine military duties such as training, patrolling, and maintenance of equipment, etc. Soldiers also played an important role outside the military sphere. They performed the function of a provincial governor's police force. As a large, disciplined and skilled force of fit men, they played a crucial role in the construction of a province's Roman military and civil infrastructure: in addition to constructing forts and fortified defences such as Hadrian's Wall , they built roads, bridges, ports, public buildings, entire new cities (Roman colonies), and also",

Soldiers, mostly drawn from polytheistic societies, enjoyed wide freedom of worship in the polytheistic Roman system. They revered their own native deities, Roman deities and the local deities of the provinces in which they served. Only a few religions were banned by the Roman authorities, as being incompatible with the official Roman religion and/or politically subversive, notably Druidism and Christianity . The later Principate saw the rise in popularity among the military of Eastern mystery cults , generally centred on one deity, and involving secret rituals divulged only to initiates. By far the most popular in the army was Mithraism , an apparently syncretist religion which mainly originated in Asia Minor . Late Roman army/East Roman army (284–641) The Late Roman army is the term used to denote the military forces of the Roman Empire from the accession of emperor Diocletian in 284 until the Empire's definitive division into Eastern and Western halves in 395. A few decades afterwards, the Western army disintegrated as the Western Empire collapsed. The East Roman army , on the other hand, continued intact and essentially unchanged until its reorganization by themes and transformation into the Byzantine army in the 7th century. The term late Roman army is often used to include the East Roman army. The army of the Principate underwent a significant transformation, as a result of the chaotic 3rd century . Unlike the Principate army, the army of the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were more poorly remunerated than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries.

The size of the 4th-century army is controversial. More dated scholars (e.g. A. H. M. Jones , writing in the 1960s) estimated the late army as much larger than the Principate army, half the size again or even as much as twice the size. With the benefit of archaeological discoveries of recent decades, many contemporary historians view the late army as no larger than its predecessor: under Diocletian c. 390,000 (the same as under Hadrian almost two centuries earlier) and under Constantine no greater, and probably somewhat smaller, than the Principate peak of c. 440,000. The main change in structure was the establishment of large armies that accompanied the emperors ( comitatus praesentales ) and were generally based away from the frontiers. Their primary function was to deter usurpations . The legions were split up into smaller units comparable in size to the auxiliary regiments of the Principate. In parallel, legionary armour and equipment were abandoned in favour of auxiliary equipment. Infantry adopted the more protective equipment of the Principate cavalry. The role of cavalry in the late army does not appear to have been enhanced as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2nd century and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. Indeed, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles in mid-4th century. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence. The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the upgrading of many existing border forts to make them more defensible, as well as the construction of new forts with much higher defensive specifications. The interpretation of this trend has fuelled an ongoing debate whether the army adopted a defence-in-depth strategy or continued the same posture of \"forward defence\" as in the early Principate.

Many elements of the late army's defence posture were similar to those associated with forward defence, such as a looser forward location of forts, frequent cross-border operations, and external buffer-zones of allied barbarian tribes.

This may have been due to heavier barbarian pressure, and/or to the practice of keeping large armies of the best troops in the interior, depriving the border forces of sufficient support. Byzantine army (641–1081) Komnenian Byzantine army (1081–1204) The Komnenian period marked a rebirth of the Byzantine army . At the beginning of the Komnenian period in 1081, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent. Surrounded by enemies, and financially ruined by a long period of civil war, the empire's prospects looked grim. At the beginning of the Komnenian period, the Byzantine army was reduced to a shadow of its former self: during the 11th century, decades of peace and neglect had reduced the old thematic forces, and the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had destroyed the professional tagmata , the core of the Byzantine army. At Manzikert and later at Dyrrhachium , units tracing their lineage for centuries back to Late Roman army were wiped out, and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor deprived the Empire of its main recruiting ground. In the Balkans, at the same time, the Empire was exposed to invasions by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily , and by Pecheneg raids across the Danube . The Byzantine army's nadir was reached in 1091, when Alexios I Komnenos could manage to field only 500 soldiers from the Empire's professional forces. These formed the nucleus of the army, with the addition of the armed retainers of Alexios' relatives and the nobles enrolled in the army and the substantial aid of a large force of allied Cumans , which won",

These formed the nucleus of the army, with the addition of the armed retainers of Alexios' relatives and the nobles enrolled in the army and the substantial aid of a large force of allied Cumans , which won the Battle of Levounion against the Pechenegs (Petcheneks or Patzinaks). [ 4 ] Yet, through a combination of skill, determination and years of campaigning, Alexios, John and Manuel Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire by constructing a new army from scratch. This process should not, however, at least in its earlier phases, be seen as a planned exercise in military restructuring. In particular, Alexios I was often reduced to reacting to events rather than controlling them; the changes he made to the Byzantine army were largely done out of immediate necessity and were pragmatic in nature. The new force had a core of units which were both professional and disciplined. It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangians , the Athanatoi , a unit of heavy cavalry stationed in Constantinople , the Vardariotai and the Archontopouloi , recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers, foreign mercenary regiments, and also units of professional soldiers recruited from the provinces. These provincial troops included kataphraktoi cavalry from Macedonia, Thessaly and Thrace, and various other provincial forces such as Trebizond archers from the Black Sea coast of Anatolia . Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state the Komnenian army included the armed followers of members of the wider imperial family and its extensive connections. In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military. The granting of pronoia holdings, where land, or more accurately rights to revenue from land, was held in return for military obligations, was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure towards the end of the Komnenian period, though it became much more important subsequently. In 1097, the Byzantine army numbered around 70,000 men altogether. [ 5 ] By 1180 and the death of Manuel Komnenos, whose",

In 1097, the Byzantine army numbered around 70,000 men altogether. [ 5 ] By 1180 and the death of Manuel Komnenos, whose frequent campaigns had been on a grand scale, the army was probably considerably larger. During the reign of Alexios I, the field army numbered around 20,000 men which was increased to about 30,000 men in John II's reign. [ 6 ] By the end of Manuel I's reign the Byzantine field army had risen to 40,000 men. Palaiologan Byzantine army (1261–1453) The Palaiologan army refers to the military forces of the Byzantine Empire from the late 13th century to its final collapse in the mid 15th century, under the House of the Palaiologoi . The army was a direct continuation of the forces of the Nicaean army, which itself was a fractured component of the formidable Komnenian army . Under the first Palaiologan emperor, Michael VIII, the army's role took an increasingly offensive role whilst the naval forces of the Empire, weakened since the days of Andronikos I Komnenos, were boosted to include thousands of skilled sailors and some 80 ships. Due to the lack of land to support the army, the Empire required the use of large numbers of mercenaries. After Andronikos II took to the throne, the army fell apart and the Byzantines suffered regular defeats at the hands of their eastern opponents, although they would continue to enjoy success against the crusader territories in Greece. By c. 1350, following a destructive civil war and the outbreak of the Black Death , the Empire was no longer capable of raising troops and the supplies to maintain them. The Empire came to rely upon troops provided by Serbs, Bulgarians, Venetians, Latins, Genoans and Ottoman Turks to fight the civil wars that lasted for the greater part of the 14th century, with the latter foe being the most successful in establishing a foothold in Thrace.

The Ottomans swiftly expanded through the Balkans and cut off Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, from the surrounding land. The last decisive battle was fought by the Palaiologan army in 1453, when Constantinople was besieged and fell on 29 May. The last isolated remnants of the Byzantine state were conquered by 1461.

    "text": "A combat medic is responsible for providing emergency medical treatment at a point of wounding in a combat or training environment, as well as primary care and health protection and evacuation from a point of injury or illness. Additionally, medics may also be responsible for the creation, oversight, and execution of long-term patient care plans in consultation with or in the absence of a readily available doctor or advanced practice provider. Combat medics may be used in hospitals and clinics, where they have the opportunity to work in additional roles, such as operating medical and laboratory equipment and performing and assisting with procedures. Canada Training All Regular Force Medical Technicians begin training with the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec . [ 1 ] Then they begin Occupational training at The Canadian Forces Health Services Training Centre in Borden, Ontario , where they are taught how to maintain medical supplies and equipment, screen patients, implement patient care plans, treat medical conditions, administer diagnostic procedures, medications, and continuous infusions. They also learn how to manage airways and assist with minor surgical procedures setting up deployed medical facilities and treating casualties in an operational and CBRNE environment over the course of 47-48 weeks. They also earn the Primary Care Paramedic Level 1 certification. Advanced training can include, Preventive Medicine, Biomedical electronics, and Aviation Physiology, among others. Assignments Medical Technicians may be posted to any Canadian ship, or base as part of the base emergency response or as part of a clinic or hospital. They can also be deployed as the medical detachment of an infantry platoon, as part of a MEDEVAC helicopter team, or on a naval vessel. [ 2 ] It is customary for soldiers to refer to their platoon medic as \"Doc\", similar to the US tradition. United States Training and certifications All military medical training in the United States takes place at Joint Base San Antonio , Fort Sam Houston , Texas . Here, among other medical jobs, Army Combat Medics, Air Force Medical Technicians, and Navy Hospital Corpsman complete their respective medical training programs.

Their scope is expanded upon by the medical provider(s) assigned to the unit, who oversees the protocols and training of assigned medical personnel. Army medics follow a career progression sequence, wherein each rank above Specialist /Corporal (E4) comes with additional required knowledge, skills, and competencies. Medics remain very versatile and may even diagnose illnesses and perform procedures usually performed by Physician Assistants , Nurse Practitioners , and Physicians. Combat Paramedic Course, Special Operations Combat Medic Course, Prolonged Field Care Course, Flight Medic/Critical Care Course, and advanced Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) such as cadaver labs are some of the educational opportunities available to medics as they progress, which include the use of goats as training aids due to their similarity to human physiology. [ 3 ] Although most of the training translates into civilian certifications/licenses, medics often train and practice on skills and with medications outside of their civilian counterparts' scope of practice. Many programs are dedicated to and who provide preference for military medics transitioning into Paramedic, Registered Nurse (RN), and Physician Assistant (PA) educations. Assignments Medics may also be assigned to combat support hospital units, forward surgical teams , and military treatment facilities and clinics where they can fulfill almost any role, from administrative duties to laboratory and medical equipment operations. When assigned to non-medical field units such as infantry , armored cavalry , artillery , combat engineers and military police , the personnel of the medical platoon are organic to the Headquarters and Headquarters Company /Detachment. The platoon is usually composed of three sections: Ambulance/Evac Section, Combat Medic/Line Medic Section, and the BAS/Treatment section. Each section is led by team leader, and the scope of practice all falls under the medical providers. Ambulance/Evac medics function just like a civilian ambulance would.

The Battalion Aid Station (BAS)/Treatment Medics function similar to an urgent care/ small emergency department depending on size and resources. Under the direction of the medical provider and team leaders or sergeants, they intake, triage, and stabilize or treat patients for transfer to another tier or discharge. Battalion Aid Stations are more mobile than Combat Support Hospitals , but have less resources available. They are intended to move as the unit advances, whereas a Combat Support Hospital would have a more long-term fixed position. Line medics are the most independent of the 3. Although they belong to Headquarters, they are attached to other platoons within a company and oversee the medical care of the soldiers assigned to them which can be anywhere from 30 to 60 Soldiers. They become a part of the group they are assigned to and with the exception of a few tasks, they do everything that their assigned soldiers do from training to missions. They are the ones who would be the first to treat an injured person and direct their immediate medical care, and are often the first to recognize when something is wrong with one of their soldiers because they spend so much time with them. They may also be the subject matter expert in advising leaders of medical planning for missions. Their co-location with the troops they are assigned allows them to easily monitor ongoing health. Being a line medic requires them to carry whatever a regular soldier carries, in addition to an aid bag and other medical supplies. These medics must be very physically fit, and able to function well in highly stressful tactical situations. They are expected to be very independent and function on their own as extensions of the provider. They make field diagnosis and manage the conditions appropriately, deferring to the provider when necessary. In the U.S. armed forces, service members in line units often refer to their assigned combat medic or hospital corpsman as \"Doc.\" Geneva Convention protection In 1864, sixteen European states adopted the first-ever Geneva Convention to save lives and alleviate the suffering of wounded and sick persons in the battlefield , as well as to protect trained medical personnel as non-combatants",

Chapter IV, Article 25 of the Geneva Convention states that: \"Members of the armed forces specially trained for employment, should the need arise, as hospital orderlies, nurses or auxiliary stretcher-bearers, in the search for or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded and sick shall likewise be respected and protected if they are carrying out these duties at the time when they come into contact with the enemy or fall into his hands.\" Article 29 reads: \"Members of the personnel designated in Article 25 who have fallen into the hands of the enemy, shall be prisoners of war , but shall be employed on their medical duties insofar as the need arises.\" According to the Geneva Convention, knowingly firing at a medic wearing clear insignia is a war crime . [ 4 ] In modern times, most combat medics carry a personal weapon, to be used to protect themselves and the wounded or sick in their care. [ 5 ] By convention this is limited to small arms (including rifles). During World War II, for example, Allied medics serving the European and Mediterranean areas usually carried the M1911A1 pistol while those serving the Pacific theater carried pistols or M1 carbines . [ 6 ] The German medics (Sanitätssoldaten) in medical units were issued with the standard-issue Kar98K , while the infantry level stretcher-bearers (Krankenträgern) and medical NCOs (Sanitätsunteroffiziere) were issued Luger or Walther pistols. When and if they use their arms offensively, they then sacrifice their protection under the Geneva Conventions .

Consequently, based on the tactical environment, medics in some armies carry a standard-issue rifle in addition to their pistol. History The Roman Army used combat medics which were referred to as Capsarii after the box (capsa) of bandages which they carried. Forts could also have hospitals integrated into their designs. [ 8 ] Surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey directed the Grande Armée of Napoleon to develop mobile field hospitals, or ambulances volantes ('flying ambulances'), in addition to a corps of trained and equipped soldiers ( infirmiers tenues de service ) to aid those on the battlefield. Before Larrey's initiative in the 1790s, wounded soldiers were either left amid the fighting until the combat ended or their comrades would carry them to the rear line. During the American Civil War , musicians had the double duty of acting as stretcher-bearers to move the wounded to field hospitals and assisting surgeons operating on patients. However, the results of using musicians as medical assistants were uneven, and while some became adept in the role others were more hindrance than help. [ 9 ] Surgeon ( Major ) Jonathan Letterman , Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac , realized a need for an integrated medical treatment and evacuation system, equipped with dedicated vehicles, organizations, facilities, and personnel. The Letterman plan for a dedicated ambulance corps was first implemented in September 1862 at the Battle of Antietam , Maryland, where it proved its worth. Soon the U.S. Ambulance Corps became an integral part of the Union Army . The Confederate States Army also implemented an ambulance corps, but it was plagued with shortages of men and materiel, making its job more difficult. [ 10 ] The United States Army's need for medical and scientific specialty officers to support combat operations resulted in the creation of two temporary components: the U.S. Army Ambulance Service , established on June 23, 1917, and the Sanitary Corps, established on June 30, 1917.

Officers of the Sanitary Corps served in medical logistics, hospital administration, patient administration, resource management, x-ray, laboratory engineering, physical reconstruction, gas defense, and venereal disease control. They were dedicated members of the medical team that enabled American generals to concentrate on enemy threats rather than epidemic threats. On August 4, 1947, Congress created the Navy Medical Service Corps . [ 11 ] In the United States, a report entitled \" Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society (1966) \", was published by National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council . Better known as \"The White Paper\" to emergency providers, it revealed that soldiers who were seriously wounded on the battlefields of Vietnam had a better survival rate than those individuals who were seriously injured in motor vehicle accidents on California freeways. Early research attributed these differences in outcome to a number of factors, including comprehensive trauma care, rapid transport to designated trauma facilities, and a new type of medical corpsman, one who was trained to perform certain critical advanced medical procedures such as fluid replacement and airway management, which allowed the victim to survive the journey to definitive care. Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Star of David The International Committee of the Red Cross , a private humanitarian institution based in Switzerland, provided the first official symbol for medical personnel.

[ 12 ] Islamic countries use a Red Crescent instead, originating from the Russo-Turkish War , when the Ottoman Empire declared that it would use a red crescent instead of a red cross as its emblem, although it agreed to respect the red cross used by the opposing Russian Empire . Although these symbols were officially sponsored by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , the Magen David Adom , Israel's emergency relief service, use the \"Magen David\", a red star of David on a white background. To enable the MDA to become a fully recognized and participating member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Protocol III was adopted, authorizing the use of the Red Crystal . For indicative use on foreign territory, any national society can incorporate its unique symbol into the Red Crystal. Under Protocol III, the MDA continues to employ the red Magen David for domestic use, and employs the Red Crystal on international relief missions. Modern day Medical personnel from most Western nations carry weapons for protection of themselves and their patients but remain designated non-combatants, wearing the red cross, crescent or crystal. United States In the United States Armed Forces, MEDEVAC vehicles display a large Red Cross on a white background. However, ground forces do not display this due to increased targeting of medical personnel by insurgents. [ 13 ] Traditionally, most United States medical personnel also wore a distinguishing red cross, to denote their protection as non-combatants under the Geneva Convention. This practice continued into World War II . However, the enemies faced by professional armies in more recent conflicts are often insurgents who either do not recognize the Geneva Convention or choose not to adhere to it, and thus readily engage all personnel, irrespective of non-combatant status. As their non-combatant status is not respected, many US medics no longer wear non-combatant markings. This can enable medics to be used as medically trained soldiers, fighting aggressively rather than just in self-defence.

The modern-day interpretation of the U.S. Army doctrine requires medics to carry one primary weapon and, if possible, a secondary weapon. [ 15 ] It is also common to find American combat medics who are no longer wearing the red or white cross because it is considered unethical to do so when the combat medic is carrying a weapon and could engage in actual combat. [ 16 ] As a result of the 2005 BRAC , the U.S. Department of Defense has moved most medical training for all branches of the armed forces to Fort Sam Houston of Joint Base San Antonio . [ 17 ] China Before the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam , the People's Liberation Army did not employ armoured ambulances, leading to difficulties in evacuation casualties from the front lines. To fill this gap, the PLA first developed the WZ750 armored ambulance based on the Type-81 tracked armored command vehicle, and later on the WZ751 and WZ 753 vehicles. [ 18 ] In addition to combat roles, PLA medics have been deployed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 19 ] Germany Following German rearmament in the 1950s, the medical service was reestablished based on the traditional structure, with a medical service for each military branch. [ 20 ] This changed in 2002, when the medical services were largely merged to form the Joint Medical Service . Since 2002, most of the former responsibilities of the Army Medical Service have been transferred to the Joint Medical Service, although the entity still exists as a much smaller organisation within the German military.

It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as\nfrom students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and\nhas been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through\noutreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of\nlectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages.\nIn the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in\nIndia. It was thought necessary to update the guidelines in the light of new\ndevelopments and fresh information.\nThe most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the\ncountry, with a robust growth rate. There have also been some important\ngovernment initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation,\nincluding the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation\nhas resulted in the opening of multinational fast food chains in Indian cities,\nincluding the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving\nearly warning signals towards the end of the previous century, when these\nguidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes\nobesity and the attendant non communicable diseases.\nThe improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant\nimprovements in purchasing power (though unevenly distributed) among\nhouseholds have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional\nstatus of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3\nshowed virtually no improvement in parameters as compared to NFHS-2, and\nrecent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more\nlight on the growing problem of the 'double burden' of undernutrition and\novernutrition.

The economic transition has\ntransformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and\nurban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today.\nThe shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased\nintake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and\n'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary\nbehaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar\nand salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The\nincreasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the\nresulting burden of chronic non-communicable diseases necessitate systematic\nnutrition educational interventions on a massive scale. There is a need for adoption\nof healthy dietary guidelines along with strong emphasis on regular physical\nexercise.\nToday, the multiple sources of health and nutrition related information tend to\ncreate unnecessary confusion among people. This book makes an attempt to inform\nus on matters of everyday nutrition in a user friendly manner and thus, aims to\ninfluence our dietary behavior. These guidelines deal with nutritional requirements\nof people during all stages of their life, right from infancy to old age.\nWe earnestly hope that readers will enjoy reading the book and benefit from it\nand also spread the valuable information among those around them.\nii",

A proper\ndiet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development\nand to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and\ndistribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The\nrecommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and technical in\nnature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components\n(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since\npeople consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather\nthan nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to\nthe food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines\nare a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice.\nThey represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets\nthat should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of\nnutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old\nage.\nFormulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing\nrequired guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary\nguidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological\nor high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and\nhealth personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the\ngoals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition.\nThe dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the\nprevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the\nsocial, economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines\ncan be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to\nreach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy.\nThe major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of\nfoods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in\nIndia are low birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy\ndeficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non-\ncommunicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of",

Population explosion, demographic changes, rapid\nurbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of\ncertain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related\nchronic diseases.\nThe dietary guidelines emphasize promotion of health and prevention of\ndisease, of all age groups with special focus on vulnerable segments of the\npopulation such as infants, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating\nwomen and the elderly. Other related factors, which need consideration are\nphysical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development,\nall of which strongly influence nutrition and health.\nIn this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative\nterms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which\ncan maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with\ntraditional habits. The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as\npulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy\ndecisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted.\nA variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common\nman, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only\nfour accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations\nand culinary practices. Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from\na variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The\ncooking oils and fat used are of several kinds. The proposed guidelines help to\nformulate health promoting recipes and diets which are region- and culture-\nspecific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of\nIndia. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.\nTranslation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several\ngovernment and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed,\nherein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance\nof optimal health. Effective IEC strategies and other large-scale educational\ncampaigns should be launched to encourage people to follow the dietary\nguidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition\nand health programs.\nnutrition",

India has been classified by the World Bank\nas a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It\nth\nranks 160 in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian\npopulation, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be\nbelow the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an\naverage, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban\nareas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable\nchronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced\nphysical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines\ndevelopment.\n Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A\ndeficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD)\nand vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently\nencountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum communities.\n Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive\nmaternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy,\nnutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with\nlow birth-weight (<2500 g) , as compared to less than 10% in the developed\ncountries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even\nduring early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of\nsevere PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %,\nnational surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub-\nclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which\nindicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there\nis a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27%\nat 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty\ninfant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community.\nPersistent undernutrition throughout the growing",

With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets\ncontaining higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and\ncomplex carbohydrates, are being frequently consumed, particularly by high-\nincome groups. In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary\nwith little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and\ntobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like\nobesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain\ntypes of cancers is on the increase.\nWidespread malnutrition is largely a result of dietary inadequacy and\nunhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty\nfeeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate\nsanitation and low agricultural production. Population living in the backward and\ndrought-prone rural areas and urban slums, and those belonging to the socially\nbackward groups like scheduled castes and tribal communities are highly\nsusceptible to undernutrition. Similarly, landless labourers and destitutes are also at\na higher risk.\nThe most rational, sustainable and long-term solution to the problem of\nmalnutrition is ensuring availability, accessability and consumption of adequate\namounts of foods.

In India, 70-80% of total\ndietary calories are derived from carbohydrates present in plant foods such as\ncereals, millets and pulses.\nDietary fibre delays and retards absorption of carbohydrates and fats and\nincreases the satiety value. Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and\nincrease the bulk of the stools. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier\nthan low-fibre diets based on refined and processed foods.\nProteins are primary structural and functional components of every living cell.\nAlmost half the protein in our body is in the form of muscle and the rest of it is in bone,\ncartilage and skin. Proteins are complex molecules composed of different amino\nacids. Certain amino acids which are termed “essential”, have to be obtained from\nproteins in the diet since they are not synthesized in the human body. Other non-\nessential amino acids can be synthesized in the body to build proteins. Proteins\nperform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 Kcal/g).\nProtein requirements vary with age, physiological status and stress. More\nproteins are required by growing infants and children, pregnant women and\nindividuals during infections and illness or stress. Animal foods like milk, meat, fish\nand eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins.\nAnimal proteins are of high quality",

Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the\ninvisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats and oils\n(cooking oil). Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and\nK and carotenes and promote their absorption. They are also sources of essential\npolyunsaturated fatty acids. It is necessary to have adequate and good quality fat in\nthe diet with sufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids in proper proportions for meeting\nthe requirements of essential fatty acids (Refer chapter 7). The type and quantity of\nfat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.\nDiets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the\ncase of infants and\nchildren, to provide concentrated energy since their energy needs per kg body\nweight are nearly twice those of adults. Adults need to be cautioned to restrict intake\nof saturated fat (butter, ghee and hydrogenated fats) and cholesterol (red meat,\neggs, organ meat).

Extra\nfood is required to meet the requirements of the fetus.\n/c63A woman prepares herself to meet the nutritional demands by increasing her\nown body fat deposits during pregnancy.\n/c63A lactating mother requires extra food to secrete adequate quantity/ quality of\nmilk and to safe guard her own health.\nPregnancy is a demanding physiological state. In India, it is observed that diets\nof women from the low socioeconomic groups are essentially similar during pre-\npregnant, pregnant and lactating periods. Consequently, there is widespread\nmaternal malnutrition leading to high prevalence of low birth weight\ninfants and very high maternal mortality. Additional foods are required\nto improve weight gain in pregnancy (10-12 Kg) and birth weight of\ninfants (about 3 Kg).\nThe daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350\ncalories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during\nsecond trimester and 22.7 g during third trimester of\npregnancy. Some micronutrients are specially required in\nextra amounts during these physiological periods.

Concentration of water-soluble vitamins as well as\nfat soluble vitamin A (beta-carotene) is influenced by the quality of the maternal diet.\nSupplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the\nlevels of these vitamins in breast-milk. Zinc and iron from breast-milk are better\nabsorbed than from other food sources. Trace element composition of breast-milk,\nhowever, is not affected by the mother's nutritional status.\nDiseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among\nformula-fed infants. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory\ntract infections. The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora. The\ngut flora and the low pH of breast-milk inhibit the growth of pathogens. Breast-milk\nhas immunoglobulins (IgA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and complements which\nprotect the infant from several infections. Antibodies to E-coli and some viruses are\nfound in breast milk, which protect the gut mucosa. Breast-feeding also protects\ninfants from vulnerability to allergic reactions.\nIt is necessary that the woman is emotionally prepared during pregnancy for\nbreast-feeding and is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet. Anxiety and emotional\nupset must be avoided and adequate rest should be ensured. It is necessary to\nprepare the breast, particularly the nipple, for breast-feeding. Mother should initiate\nbreast-feeding as early as possible after delivery and feed the child on demand. Milk\nproduction of the mother is determined by the infant’s demand. Frequent sucking by\nthe baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate\nbreast milk output. A working mother can express her breast milk and store it\nhygienically up to 8 hrs. This can be fed",

When replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable,\nsustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the\nfirst months of life. Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding\nfor up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and\ncomplete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission\nthrough breast feeding. However, such mothers will be informed about the risk of\ntransmission of HIV through breast milk and its consequences. In addition, based on\nthe principle of informed choice, HIV infected women should be counseled about the\nrisk of HIV transmission through breast milk and the risks and benefits of each\nfeeding method, with specific guidance in selecting the option most likely to be\nsuitable for their situation.

Fortunately, in\nIndia, most rural mothers are able to breast-feed their children for prolonged periods.\nIn fact, this is a boon to Indian children as otherwise the prevalence of under-nutrition\namong them would have been much higher. However, often, children are solely\nbreast-fed even beyond the age of one year in the belief that breast-milk alone is\nadequate for the child until he/she is able to pick up food and eat. This practice\nresults in under-nutrition among young children. Working mothers, on the other\nhand are unable to breast-feed their children for longer periods, as they go to work\noutside.\nFoods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing\nsufficient nutrients are known as supplementary or complementary foods. These\ncould be liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid\npreparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year.\nAt birth, mother's milk alone is adequate for the infant. Requirements of all the\nnutrients progressively increase with the infant's growth. Simultaneously, the breast-\nmilk secretion in the mother comes down with time. Thus, infants are deprived of\nadequate nutrients due to the dual factors of increased nutrient requirements and\ndecreased availability of breast-milk. Usually, these changes occur at about 6\nmonths of age. Hence, promotion of optimal growth in infants, calls for introduction of\nadequate food supplements in addition to continued breast feeding, from the age of\n6 months onwards.\nEasy to cook home made preparations are hygenic and\nhealthy foods for the growing baby",

Such supplements are easily digested by all infants,\nincluding those with severe malnutrition. The impression that only the commercially\navailable supplementary foods are nutritious is not correct. Some examples of low\ncost complementary foods are given on page 33.\nWeaning foods based on cereal-pulse-nut and sugar/ jaggery combinations will\nprovide good quality protein, adequate calories and other protective nutrients.\nSince infants cannot consume bulky complementary food, in sufficient quantities,\nenergy-rich foods like fats and sugars should be included in such preparations.\nInfants can also be fed green leafy vegetables (GLVs), which are rich, yet\ninexpensive , sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well\ncleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions. Dietary fibre in green\nleafy vegetables can, by itself, promote the bowel movements leading to loose\nmotions in infants. Since GLVs are rich in dietary fibre, it is advisable to initially feed\nonly the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly. Infants should be introduced\nto different vegetables and fruits gradually. It should, however, be remembered that\nthese dietary articles should be thoroughly cooked and mashed before feeding. In\nfamilies which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced. At about one\nyear of age, the child should share the family diet.\nFlours of germinated cereals, which are rich\nin the enzyme alpha-amylase, constitute ARFs.\nEven small amounts of this type of foods liquefy\nand reduce the bulk of the cereal-based diet.\nThus, ARFs help in increasing the energy\ndensity of weaning gruels and in reducing its\nbulk as well.\nMothers can add ARF to increase the\ndigestibility of the low-cost weaning foods\nprepared at home. Preparation of ARF is\nvery simple and can be done by mothers\nat home.",

The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss\nusing oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding.\nORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger)\nand a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice\nkanji or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should\nfrequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water. During\ndiarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular\npractice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus,\nprevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.\nThe diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about\n1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of\ncereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition.\nFat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense.\nMilk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not\ntolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed\nvegetables may be incorporated in the diet. Feeding becomes easier after the\ninfection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra\nfood (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty.\nDeficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or\nchronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem.

Fats, in processed and ready to eat\nfoods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat. However,\ntheir contribution to overall fat intake is significant as they contribute to bulk of our\nIndian diets. The small amounts of invisible fat present in various foods add up to a\nsubstantial level in our daily diet (about 15 g in rural population and 30g among urban\nmiddle-income and high-income groups). Most animal foods provide high amounts\nof invisible fat.\nThe total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total\ncalories. The visible fat intake in the diets can go upto 50g/person/day based on the\nlevel of physical activity and physiological status. Adults with sedentary lifestyle\nshould consume about 25 g of visible fat, while individuals involved in hard physical\nwork require 30 - 40g of visible fat. Visible fat intake should be increased during\npregnancy and lactation to 30g. The higher fat and EFA requirements during\npregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in\nview of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development.

Tocotrienols in palm oil, lignans in sesame oil and oryzanol and tocotrienols\nin rice-bran oil reduce blood cholesterol. Refining of oils, though does not alter their\nfatty acid composition, modifies the composition of minor components; for example,\ncaro tenes are lost during refining of crude palm oil.\nCholesterol : Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk,\nmeat, shrimp and prawn, but not in plant foods.

Body weight for a\ngiven height of person with good health and long lifespan is considered as Ideal\nbody weight. A much simpler and more acceptable measure is the ratio of weight\nand height, which estimates total body mass and correlates highly with the % of\nbody fat. The most commonly used ratio is the BMI. It is computed by dividing the\nweight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷\n(Height M) ]. The ideal ranges of weights for a given height are provided by WHO\n(annexure 5), which is useful for categorizing persons as normal (ideal), under-\nnourished and overweight or obese.\nDefinition of obesity is based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general\naccumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered to be\nmore harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat around abdomen\nindicated by higher waist circumference is considered as risk factor. In general, BMI\nranging from 18.5 to 25 is considered to be normal. However, for Asians it is\nrecommended that the BMI should be between 18.5 and 23, since, they tend to have\nhigher percentage body fat even at lower BMI compared to Caucasians and\nEuropeans, which puts them at higher risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.\nO\nchronic non-communicable diseases including heart\ndisease, diabetes and certain types of cancers\nverweight/obesity is the causative factor for",

Waist-to-hip ratio of more than 0.9 among men and 0.8 in\nwomen and waist circumference 90cm for men and 80cm for women are associated\nwith increased risk of several chronic diseases especially in Asian Indians.\nThere are several health consequences of obesity.

It is therefore, necessary to maintain a desirable body weight by\nconsuming just enough calories or adjust physical activity to maintain energy\nbalance (intake = output). Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored\nperiodically.\nSeveral studies have suggested that hours spent in watching television is\nstrongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the\nsedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television\nand influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.\nAdults usually tend to gain weight between the ages of 25-50 years.

Weight reduction diets should not be less than\n1000 Kcal/day and provide all nutrients. A reduction of half a kilogram body weight\nper week is considered to be safe. Extreme approaches should be avoided and use\nof drugs may be dangerous. In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing\nphysical activity rather than restricting food intake. Modifications in dietary habits\nhave to be incorporated into one's lifestyle along with adequate exercise to keep the\nbody weight within the normal limits.\nAs fat contains more than twice the calories (9Kcal) per gram compared to\nprotein (4Kcal) and carbohydrate (4Kcal), weight reducing diets should limit the fat\nintake. Refined sugars (4Kcal) and alcohol (7Kcal) provide empty calories and\nshould be avoided.

Weight- reducing diets must be\nrich in proteins and low in carbohydrates and fats. Consumption of plenty of fruits\nand vegetables would not only result in satiety but could also help to maintain\nadequate micronutrient intake. Frequent fasting/ semi-fasting (cyclic weight\nreduction) followed by adequate or excess food consumption will also aggravate the\nproblem of weight gain.

Potassium-rich foods\nsuch as fresh vegetables and fruits decrease blood pressure. In fact, it is the ratio of\nsodium to potassium in the diet which is important. Salt intake higher than 8 g/day is\nconsidered as a risk factor for hypertension.\nBesides increasing blood pressure, excessive salt may also affect stomach\nmucosa and result in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.\nHigher sodium intake leads to greater calcium excretion which may result in\nreduction in bone density. Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt\nintake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. Salt intake\nin our population generally exceeds the requirement. It should not be more than 6 g\nper day. Salt is used as a vehicle for food fortification since, it is commonly used in\nfood preparation.\nWhat are the health problems associated with excessive salt/sodium intake?",

In addition to moisture and\nenvironmental conditions like temperature, storage time also influence the quality of\nthe food.\nSelection of the right food is the first step to ensure safe and good quality diet.\nFood items purchased from reliable sources having a high turnover ensure their\nfreshness. Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example\nAGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable\nproducts (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours\nand essences. While purchasing packaged food always look for ‘best before’ or\n‘date of expiry’.\nFood grains purchased should be free from infestation and foreign matter\n(rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not\nbe shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors.\nThere is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed\ncontainers. Therefore, it is always safer to purchase reputed brand products in\nsealed sachets/containers. It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a\nreputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination.\nMilk products such as butter, ghee and khoa should also be purchased from reliable\nsources.

As more and more women go to work outside, and\nfamilies have become nuclear, consumption of processed foods, particularly in\nurban areas, will be on the increase. Today's consumer is looking for convenient,\neasy-to-cook, and ready-to-eat foods which require less time to prepare than\ntraditional home-cooked foods. Food processing is must to preserve highly\nperishable products like milk, meat, fish and fresh fruits and vegetables. Food\nprocessing increases the seasonal availability of foods and enables easy\ntransportation and distribution over long distances.\nProcessed foods being rich in fats, salt, sugar and preserva-\ntives may pose a health risk if consumed regularly",

    "text": "Do processed foods contribute to nutrient intake?\nWhat is the difference between instant foods, fast foods, street foods and\nunhealthy (junk) foods?\nProcessed foods are generally consumed either as part of a meal, or as a snack\nitem. Their contribution in terms of essential nutrients depends on the type of\nprocessing and fortification, the frequency of use, and the quantity consumed.\nProcessed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in\nsalt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus,\ncaution needs to be exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the\nmeal.\nBreakfast cereals are increasingly being used in urban areas. Traditional\nbreakfast items like idli, dosa, upma and roti are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and\nparched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily\ndigestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are\npopular among children, are considered as unhealthy since, they provide only\nempty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should\nbe discouraged.\nInstant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or\nto disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance,\ninstant noodles, soup powders, cornflakes fall under this category. Although all\ninstant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are\nconcerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which\nmay also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods.\nFast foods are foods already made or cooked to order within minutes for\nconsumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas,\nsandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major\nconcerns. Further they are calorie dense foods.\nStreet foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages\nprepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public\nplaces. Idly, Wada, Dosa , Chat Items etc are examples of street foods. They may be\ncontaminated with pathogenic organisms unless hygienically prepared.\nInstant foods\nFast Foods\nStreet Foods",

    "text": "Unhealthy (Junk) Foods\nUnhealthy foods are those containing little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals but\nare rich in salt, sugar, fats and are high in energy (calories). Some examples are\nchocolates, artificially flavored aerated drinks, potato chips, ice creams, french fries\netc.\nFrequent consumption of unhealthy processed food increases calorie intake\nwithout providing any nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Apart from being non-\nnutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed\nbeyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food\nregulatory authorities periodically review these limits. Thus, consumption of\nprocessed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the\nrisk of exposure to various chemical additives.\nIn the coming years, with larger constraints on time at home, demand for\nprocessed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that\nintake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of\nvarious processed and convenience foods. Processed vegetables and fruits\navailable in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits.\nSugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present\nin natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste\nand texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, ice-\ncreams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar\n(sucrose) provides “empty calories”. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery\nand sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined\ncereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated\nblood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental\ncarries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals\nshould be sparingly used.\nWhy should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods?\nWhy should we moderate intake of sugar ?",

Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the\ndomestic sphere.\nResistance to disease declines in the elderly.

Simple modification in lifestyle like\ndeliberately climbing up the stairs instead of using the lift and walking for short distance\ninstead of using a vehicle could also immensely help in increasing our physical activity.\nExercise program should include 'warm up' and 'cool down' periods each lasting for 5\nminutes. During exercise, the intensity of exercise should ensure 60-70% increase in heart\nrate.\nInactive men over the age of 40 years, women over the age of 50 years and people at\nhigh risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes should first consult a physician\nbefore engaging in a program of vigorous physical activity such as running and swimming.\nActivity Kcal/hr Activity Kcal/hr\nCleaning/Mopping 210 Shuttle 348\nGardening 300 Table Tennis 245\nWatching TV 86 Tennis 392\nCycling Volley Ball 180\n15 (Km/hr) 360 Dancing 372\nRunning Fishing 222\n12 (Km/hr) 750 Shopping 204\n10 (Km/hr) 655 Typing 108\n8 (Km/hr) 522 Sleeping 57\n6 (Km/hr) 353 Standing 132\nWalking 4 (Km/hr) 160 Sitting 86\n* Approx. energy expenditure for 60 Kg reference man.

    "text": "Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food Products by\nDifferent Methods\nMost of the pesticide residues can be removed by adopting four methods.\nThese methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the\npesticide residues. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.\nWashing\nThe first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is\nwashing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing.\nWashing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that\nnormally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.\nThe pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava,\nplums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require\n2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The\npesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal\nprocessing such as washing, blanching and cooking.\nBlanching\nBlanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the\nvegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.\nBut before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and\nfruits.\nPeeling\nContact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be\nremoved by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from\nthe raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net\ninfluence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed\nfood.\nAnnexure - 12",

Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. This page includes a few quick and easy tips on how to make healthy dietary choices. Background Good nutrition is about consistently choosing healthy foods and beverages. Healthy eating patterns can include foods and beverages that reflect preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations . Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Dairy recommendations include low-fat or fat-free milk, lactose-free milk, and fortified soy beverages. Other plant-based beverages do not have the same nutritional properties as animal's milk and soy beverages. Protein recommendations include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), soy products, nuts, and seeds. Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started. Bump up fiber Fiber helps maintain digestive health and helps us feel fuller longer. Fiber also helps control blood sugar and lowers cholesterol levels. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds are good sources of fiber. To bump up fiber, try this: Slice raw vegetables for quick snacks. Start your day with a whole-grain cereal, like oatmeal. Foods made with bulgur or quinoa are also high in fiber. Top your cereal with berries, pumpkin seeds, or almonds. A half-cup of beans or lentils on a salad can add texture and flavor. Enjoy fresh fruit with a meal or as dessert. Increase calcium and vitamin D Calcium and vitamin D work together to promote optimal bone health. Our bodies can make vitamin D from sunshine. However, some people may have a hard time producing enough vitamin D. And too much sun exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. Foods and beverages are often fortified with this essential nutrient. See food sources of calcium and vitamin D . To increase calcium and vitamin D intake, try this: Drink a fortified dairy beverage with your meals. Add sardines to your lunch once a week. Canned salmon is another great option. Sardines and salmon with bones have more calcium than these products without bones. Canned salmon is",

Add more potassium Potassium helps the kidneys, heart, muscles and, nerves function properly. Not getting enough potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones. People with chronic kidney disease and people taking certain medications may have too much potassium in their blood. But most people in the United States need to consume more potassium. See food sources of potassium . To add more potassium, try this: Try new recipes that use beets, lima beans, or Swiss chard. Try a variety of drinks high in potassium. 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice. Fat-free milk and low-fat kefir. 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice. Fat-free milk and low-fat kefir.

    "text": "Nutrition Facts Label and Your Health Key points The Nutrition Facts Label on packaged foods is based on dietary recommendations for Americans. Read the label on your packaged food and drinks to track sugars, fats, protein, and other nutrients. Using the label can help you choose foods for a healthy diet. Overview The Nutrition Facts Label on packaged foods is based on dietary recommendations for Americans. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates what goes on the Nutrition Facts Label. Below are explanations of parts of the label and some tips for using it to follow healthy eating patterns. Serving size The serving size reflects what people are likely to eat or drink. This is not necessarily the portion you should eat. For example, one serving size of ice cream is labeled as ⅔ cup. A 12–ounce or 20–ounce bottle of soda is labeled as one serving. Be sure you know how many servings are in packaged food. For example, if you buy what looks like an individual sized chicken pie, check the Nutrition Facts Label. It might actually be two servings. with double the calories and sodium of a single serving. Dual Column Labels Some food and drink packages that contain more than one serving may have a dual column Nutrition Facts Label. In that case, one column on the Nutrition Facts Label may provide calorie and nutrition information for one serving. Another column may provide calorie and nutrition information for the whole package. Calories and fat Larger, darker letters make calories the easiest item to see. When it comes to health outcomes, the type of fat you eat matters more than the overall amount of fat. The Nutrition Facts Label shows total fat in grams and percentages of calories from fat. The Nutrition Facts Label has separate lines for saturated and trans fats, which are less healthy than other types of fat. Look for foods with very little saturated and trans fats. Sodium The recommended daily limit for sodium is 2,300 milligrams. The Nutrition Facts Label indicates the number of milligrams of sodium in a serving. Most sodium we consume is from salt, which is a common ingredient in processed foods. Read the Nutrition Facts Labels and choose the product with less sodium. Added Sugars The Nutrition Facts Label shows the percentage of calories from added sugars. Naturally occurring sugars, such as those in fruit or milk, are not added sugars. Added sugars include brown sugar, maple sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, and molasses. The two main sources of added sugars in the United States are sug",

Added sugars include brown sugar, maple sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, and molasses. The two main sources of added sugars in the United States are sugary drinks and desserts/sweet snacks. Keep your intake of added sugars to less than 10% of your total daily calories. That means if you consume 2,000 calories in a day, added sugars should account for no more than 200 calories. If you eat even one large dessert or sugary drink per day, you are likely getting more than the recommended daily limit of added sugar. Try drinking plain water instead of sugary drinks and limiting the serving size of treats. See how to Rethink Your Drink and Be Sugar Smart .

While sodium has many forms, most sodium we consume is from salt. Most Americans consume too much sodium. Most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods. Health risks Eating too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for heart disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause. Most people eat too much sodium Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your health. Americans consume more than 3,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, on average. This is well above the federal recommendation of less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily for teens and adults as part of a healthy eating pattern. Sodium in everyday foods adds up Sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories. Some of the top sources of sodium for U.S. adults and children ages 1 and older include: Sandwiches. Rice, pasta, and other grain-based dishes. Starchy and non-starchy vegetables. Meat, poultry, and seafood dishes. Pizza. Soups. Chips, crackers, and savory snacks. Desserts and sweet snacks. Condiments and gravies. Cold cuts and cured meats. Breads and tortillas. Source: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 Sodium or salt? Salt and sodium are not the same. Salt is sodium chloride which is table salt. Sodium chloride is 40% sodium and 60% chloride. One teaspoon of table salt contains about 2,400 mg of sodium. Sodium is a mineral found in many ingredients in common foods: Monosodium glutamate (MSG). Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Sodium nitrate (a preservative).

Why it matters Good nutrition is important for young children to help them grow healthy and strong. Children need a variety of nutritious foods each day for healthy growth and brain development. Early eating experiences can also affect how people eat as they get older. This is why it is important to introduce young children to healthy foods, including a variety of fruits and vegetables. Follow these tips to help your picky eater try new foods. Try different approaches Try eating the food first to show them you like it. Then, let them try it. Make funny faces with the foods on their plate. It may help them get excited to eat it. Give them a choice of different foods to try. Let them decide which one to try today. Serve new foods with foods you know they like. Try freezing small bites of leftover foods. You can use these later and avoid throwing food away. Wait a couple of days before offering the food again. It can take more than 10 times before your child likes it. As children get older, they may start refusing foods they used to like or start showing signs of being a picky eater. Favoring just a couple of foods or not wanting foods to touch each other on the plate are normal behaviors. These behaviors often go away by the time the child is about 5 years old. Children may need to try some foods many times. Children may not like every food you give them on the first try. Give them a chance to try foods again and again, even if they don't like them at first. Children may need to try some foods many times before they like them. Try a variety of tastes and textures Giving your child foods with a variety of different tastes and textures can help them learn to accept and like a variety of foods. You can let your child try a variety of textures including: Smooth (strained or pureed). Mashed or lumpy. Finely chopped or ground. Start with smooth or mashed foods first and then move towards finely chopped or ground foods as they get older. This can help your child develop chewing skills, as well as fine motor skills like pinching and picking up food with their fingers. Be sure to offer foods in the right size, consistency, and shape for your child's age and development to help prevent choking. Keep it fun! Try these playful activities",

Most sodium in our diets comes from packaged and restaurant food, not the salt shaker. You can reduce sodium intake by following the tips below at the grocery store, at home, and in restaurants. Why it's important Eating too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for heart disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause. Even foods that may not taste salty can be major sources of sodium. Foods with only moderate amounts of sodium, such as bread, can be major sources of sodium because they’re eaten so frequently. At the grocery store Buy fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables with no salt or sauce added. Choose packaged foods labeled \"low sodium,\" \"reduced sodium,\" or \"no salt added\" when available. Compare the amount of sodium in different products by reading Nutrition Facts labels . Check the amount of sodium per serving and the number of servings per container. Choose the options with the lowest amounts of sodium. When possible, purchase fresh poultry, fish, pork, and lean meat, rather than cured, salted, smoked, and other processed meats. For fresh items, check to see whether saline or salt solution has been added—if so, choose another brand. Ask your grocer if they have a low sodium shopping list available. Tip‎ At home When cooking, replace or reduce the amount of salt you use. Alternatives could be garlic, citrus juice, salt-free seasonings, or spices. Prepare rice, pasta, beans, and meats from their most basic forms (dry and fresh) when possible. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Limit sauces, mixes, and instant products, including flavored rice and ready-made pasta. At restaurants Ask for nutrition information before you order, and select a lower sodium meal. Ask that no salt be added to your meal. Order vegetables with no salt added or fruit as a side item. Split a meal with a friend or family member. Keep takeout and fast food to an occasional treat. Choose a heart-healthy diet The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan is a simple, heart-healthy diet that can help prevent or lower high blood pressure. The DASH diet is low in sodium, cholesterol, and saturated and total fats. The diet is high in fruits and vegetables, fiber, potassium, and low-fat dairy",

    "text": "About Nutrition Key points Good nutrition is essential to keep current and future generations of Americans healthy across the lifespan. Poor nutrition affects our economy. CDC works with communities, states, national groups, and global partners to improve nutrition. Why it matters Good nutrition is essential across life stages, from infant and child growth and brain development to healthy and safer pregnancies and healthy aging. Micronutrients, often referred to as vitamins and minerals, are vital to healthy development, growth, disease prevention, and well-being. Here are six essential micronutrients and why they are important to our health. Breastfeeding helps protect against childhood illnesses. Such illnesses include ear and severe lower respiratory infections, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Low levels of certain vitamins and minerals can result in mental impairment and central nervous system defects in infants. Most mothers start out breastfeeding, but about 6 in 10 stop sooner than they planned. Low rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to medical costs for women and children in the United States. Adults with healthy eating patterns live longer and are at lower risk for serious, costly health problems. Examples include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. What CDC is doing CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) works with three state and local programs to ensure access to good nutrition for all people: State Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) High Obesity Program (HOP) Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Through the International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control Program , we help improve vitamin and mineral nutrition in the United States and globally. We also collaborate with the Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN). DNPAO created NOPREN to foster understanding of effective policies to prevent obesity. Prevention efforts of focus are improved access to affordable, healthier foods and beverages in childcare, schools, worksite, and other community settings. Priorities We encourage state and local organizations to implement policies and activities to: Promote food service and nutrition guidelines where food is sold, served, and distributed. Coordinate the uptake of and expansion of existing voucher incentive and produce prescription programs . Achieve continuity of care for those who breastfeed . Improve nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding in early care and education settings. Milestones In the United States, the percentage of births in hospitals with recommended maternity care practices to support breastfeeding increased from 3.8% in 2010 to ",

Many states require licensed childcare programs to follow science-based infant feeding and nutrition standards. This affects the meals and snacks of millions of young children. In 2023, more than 6,100 schools obtained and offered salad bars. This increased healthy fruit and vegetable options for more than 3.5 million children and school staff.

The problem Micronutrient deficiencies can have significant consequences on our health and well-being, yet: Approximately 1 in 4 U.S. women has iron deficiency during pregnancy. Approximately 1 in 8 U.S. women aged 12 to 49 has iron deficiency. More than half of children younger than 5 worldwide suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

Two ways states and communities can help make healthy food choices easier everywhere are to: Promote food service and nutrition guidelines where food is sold, served, or distributed. Expand fruit and vegetable voucher incentive and produce prescription programs. Make breastfeeding easier to start and continue Supporting breastfeeding where mothers give birth, live, work, play, and raise children makes it easier for families to initiate and continue breastfeeding. It can help eliminate disparities in breastfeeding rates. See policies and activities that can help achieve continuity of care .

See tips for drinking more water throughout the day. Benefits of drinking water Getting enough water every day is important for health. Drinking water can prevent dehydration, which may cause unclear thinking, mood change, overheating, constipation, and kidney stones. Water has no calories, so replacing sugary drinks with plain water can help reduce caloric intake. Water helps your body: Keep a normal temperature. Lubricate and cushion joints. Protect your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues. Get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements. Your body needs more water when you are: In hot climates. More physically active. Running a fever. Having diarrhea or vomiting. Meeting your water intake every day Daily water intake recommendations vary by age, sex, pregnancy status, activity level, and breastfeeding status. Daily water intake is mostly from water and other beverages. Foods, especially those with high water content such as many fruits and vegetables, can also add to fluid intake. Tips to drink more water Carry a reusable water bottle with you. Freeze water in freezer-safe bottles for ice-cold water all day. Choose water over sugary drinks. Opt for water when eating out. Serve water during meals. Add a wedge of lime or lemon to your water. Healthier drink options Many other beverages can be part of healthy eating patterns. Low- or no- calorie beverages Plain coffee or teas, sparkling water, seltzers, and flavored waters are low-calorie choices. Drinks with important nutrients Low-fat or fat-free milk; unsweetened, fortified milk alternatives; and 100% fruit or vegetable juice contain important nutrients. Enjoy these drinks within recommended calorie limits. Other beverages Sugary drinks: Regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters, and sweetened coffee and tea contain calories but little nutritional value . Learn how to Rethink Your Drink . Alcoholic drinks : If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Caffeinated drinks: Moderate caffeine consumption (up to 400 mg per day) can be a part of a healthy diet . That's about 3 to 5 cups of plain coffee. Drinks with sugar alternatives: Drinks that are labeled \"sugar-free\" or \"diet\" likely contain high-intensity sweeteners, such as sucralose, aspartame",

Comfort foods, in limited amounts, can be part of healthy eating patterns. Why it's important People with healthy eating patterns live longer and are at lower risk for serious health problems such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. For people with chronic diseases, healthy eating can help manage these conditions and prevent complications. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 , a healthy eating plan: Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. Includes a variety of protein foods. Healthful options include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), soy products, nuts, and seeds. Is low in added sugars , sodium (salt) , saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Stays within your daily calorie needs . USDA's MyPlate Plan can identify what to eat, how much to eat from the different food groups, and how to stay within your recommended calorie allowance. My Food Diary can help you track meals and snacks. Keep reading for specific tips for fruit, vegetables, calcium-rich foods, meat, and comfort food. Fruit Fresh, frozen, or canned fruits are great choices. Try fruits beyond apples and bananas, such as mangos, pineapples, or kiwis. When fresh fruit is not in season, try a frozen, canned, or dried variety. Be aware that dried and canned fruit may contain added sugars or syrups. Choose canned varieties of fruit packed in water or in its own juice. Vegetables Add variety to grilled or steamed vegetables with an herb such as rosemary. You can also sauté (pan-fry) vegetables in a non-stick pan with a small amount of cooking spray. Or try frozen or canned vegetables for a quick side dish—just microwave and serve. Frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions can give stews and omelets a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients. Look for frozen and canned vegetables without added salt, butter, or cream sauces. Calcium-rich foods In addition to fat-free and low-fat milk, consider low-fat and fat-free yogurts without added sugars. These come in a variety of flavors and can be a great dessert substitute. Fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon are also good sources of calcium . Vitamin D",

Fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon are also good sources of calcium . Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption. Sources of vitamin D can include: Fortified drinks such as milk and fortified soy beverages. Fortified foods such as yogurt or some cereals. Some seafoods. Meats If your favorite recipe calls for frying fish or breading chicken, try healthier variations by baking or grilling. Maybe even try dry beans in place of meats. Ask friends or search the internet and magazines for recipes with fewer calories. You might be surprised to find you have a new favorite dish! Comfort foods You can still enjoy your favorite foods, even if they are high in calories, fat, or added sugars. The key is eating them only once in a while. Some general tips for comfort foods: Eat them less often. If you normally eat these foods every day, cut back to once a week or once a month. Eat smaller amounts. If your favorite higher-calorie food is a chocolate bar, have a smaller size or only half a bar. Try a lower-calorie version . Use lower-calorie ingredients or prepare food differently. For example, a macaroni and cheese recipe might include whole milk, butter, and full-fat cheese. You can try remaking it with non-fat milk, less butter, low-fat cheese, fresh spinach, and tomatoes. Remember to not increase your portion size.

    "text": "Steps for Losing Weight Key points If you want to lose weight, making a specific plan can help. Healthy weight loss includes a lifestyle with healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, enough sleep, and stress management. The five steps on this page can help you get started. Overview A lifestyle with good nutrition, regular physical activity, stress management, and enough sleep supports a healthy weight. People who lose weight at a gradual, steady pace—about 1 to 2 pounds a week—are more likely to keep the weight off than people who lose weight quicker. Factors, such as medicines, medical conditions, stress, genes, hormones, environment, and age can also affect weight management . If you're concerned about your weight or have questions about your medications, talk with your health care provider. When you are ready to get started, explore these five steps to guide you to a healthier weight. Step 1: Understand your \"why\" Consider why you want to lose weight, whether it's because heart disease runs in your family or you want to be more physically active. Writing down your reasons will help you stay focused on your goal. Place your reasons where you can see them daily to remind yourself why you want to make this change. Even modest weight loss helps If you are not at a healthy weight, even modest weight loss can help improve your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. For example, a 5% weight reduction for a person who weighs 200 pounds is 10 pounds. This change could lower the risk for some chronic diseases such as heart disease, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Step 2: Track where you are Tracking where you are now helps to identify how you want to improve your health. You can start by tracking your nutrition, physical activity, and sleep. Write down or use an app to track: Nutrition: Include everything you consume for a few days in a food and beverage diary . This will help you see what you eat and drink and consider how to make small changes. Physical activity: Include time of day, what activity you did, and duration in a physical activity diary . Sleep : Include the hours of sleep you get. The amount you need changes as you age. Stress: Include healthy ways you are reducing your stress . Other wellness factors you can track include how you are feeling when you eat and drink and are active, and lifestyle challenges. To track lifestyle challenges, you can ask yourself questions like the ones included in the table below",

Other wellness factors you can track include how you are feeling when you eat and drink and are active, and lifestyle challenges. To track lifestyle challenges, you can ask yourself questions like the ones included in the table below. If you answer yes, consider ways to overcome those challenges. Lifestyle challenge Consideration to overcome challenge Does your work schedule make it hard to be physically active? Walk to work or take public transportation. Take walk breaks at work. Ask a coworker to join you for a walk at lunch or after work. Do you eat sugary foods because that's what you buy for your kids? Have fruits and vegetables on hand to quickly grab. Bring the family together to create healthier changes for everyone at home. Plan meals ahead of time. Do your coworkers bring in treats to share? Bring healthier snacks to share with your coworkers. Start a wellness committee at work to promote healthier eating among your coworkers. Meet with human resources to discuss having the workplace offer healthier options. Do you feel tired because you are not getting enough sleep? Set regular bed and wake times. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening. Turn off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime. Step 3: Set specific goals you can reach in a realistic time Set short-term goals and reward your efforts along the way. Short-term goals might include drinking water instead of sugary beverages, taking a 15-minute evening walk, or having a vegetable with supper. Focus on two or three goals at a time. Effective goals are specific and realistic. For example, \"exercise more\" is not specific. But \"I will walk 15 minutes, 3 days a week for the first week,\" is specific and potentially more realistic. Setting unrealistic goals, such as losing 20 pounds in 2 weeks, can leave you feeling defeated and frustrated. Remember, occasional setbacks happen. This is expected. When they happen, get back on track as quickly as possible. Then, think about how to prevent setbacks in similar future situations. Everyone is different. What works for someone else might not be right for you. For example, to help you be more active, try a variety of physical activities, such as walking, swimming, tennis, or",

What works for someone else might not be right for you. For example, to help you be more active, try a variety of physical activities, such as walking, swimming, tennis, or group exercise classes. See what you enjoy most and can fit into your life. These activities will be easier to stick with over the long term. Step 4: Find support Identify family members or friends who will support your weight loss efforts. Coworkers or neighbors with similar goals might share healthy recipes and plan group physical activities. It may help to join a weight-loss program or visit a health care professional, such as a nutrition or weight-loss specialist. Ask for a follow-up appointment to monitor changes in your weight and any related health conditions. You can also ask your health care provider for resources to support a healthy weight. This may include referral to a registered dietitian, clinical or community programs, federally approved medications or devices, or weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. Establishing healthy habits are very difficult when healthy choices are limited. Consider looking up your local community resources, such as food pantries, farmers markets, parks and recreation, and trails. Food assistance and food systems resources Resources for food assistance in everyday situations, as well as before, during, and after emergencies and disasters. These resources are for individuals and organizations. Step 5: Monitor your progress Evaluate your progress regularly by revisiting your goals. Decide which parts of your plan are working well and which parts need to be changed. Use this information to revise your goals and plan. If you consistently meet a particular goal, add a new goal to help continue your pathway to success. Reward yourself for your achievements! Recognize when you're meeting your goals and be proud of your progress. Use non-food rewards, such as a bouquet of fresh flowers, a sports outing with friends, or a relaxing bath. Rewards help keep you motivated on the path to better health.

As a consequence, considerable research has been carried out to\nbetter understand their physiological role and the health consequences of\nmicronutrient-deﬁcient diets, to establish criteria for deﬁning the degree of\npublic health severity of micronutrient malnutrition, and to develop preven-\ntion and control strategies.\nOne of the main outcomes of this process is greatly improved knowledge\nof human micronutrient requirements, which is a crucial step in understand-\ning the public health signiﬁcance of micronutrient malnutrition and identify-\ning the most appropriate measures to prevent them. This process also led to\nsuccessive expert consultations and publications organized jointly by the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) providing up-to-date knowledge and deﬁning standards for micronu-\ntrient requirements in 1973\n1, 19882 and in 19963. In recognition of this rapidly\ndeveloping ﬁeld, and the substantial new advances that have been made since\nthe most recent publication in 1996, FAO and WHO considered it appropri-\nate to convene a new expert consultation to re-evaluate the role of micronu-\ntrients in human health and nutrition.\nTo this end, background papers on the major vitamins, minerals and trace\nelements were commissioned and reviewed at a Joint FAO/WHO Expert\nConsultation (Bangkok, 21–30 September 1998). That Expert Consultation\nwas assigned three main tasks:\n• Firstly, the Consultation was asked to review the full range of vitamin and\nmineral requirements—19 micronutrients in all—including their role in\nxiii\n1 Trace elements in human nutrition.

The\nreport should provide practical advice and recommendations which will\nconstitute an authoritative source of information to all those from Member\nStates who work in the areas of nutrition, agriculture, food production and\ndistribution, and health promotion.\n• Thirdly, the Consultation was asked to identify key issues for future\nresearch concerning each vitamin and mineral under review and to make\npreliminary recommendations on that research.\nThe present report presents the outcome of the Consultation combined\nwith up-to-date evidence that has since become available to answer a number\nof issues which remained unclear or controversial at the time of the Consul-\ntation. It was not originally thought that such an evidence-based consultation\nprocess would be so controversial, but the reality is that there are surprisingly\nfew data on speciﬁc health status indicators on which to base conclusions,\nwhereas there is a great deal of information relative to overt deﬁciency disease\nconditions. The deﬁning of human nutrient requirements and recommended\nintakes are therefore largely based on expert interpretation and consensus on\nthe best available scientiﬁc information.\nWhen looking at recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) in industrialized\ncountries over the last 25 years, it is noticeable that for some micronutrients\nthese have gradually increased. The question is whether this is the result of\nbetter scientiﬁc knowledge and understanding of the biochemical role of the\nnutrients, or whether the criteria for setting requirement levels have changed,\nor a combination of both.

The popula-\ntions that are targeted for prevention through “optimal nutrition” are char-\nacterized by sedentary lifestyles and longer life expectancy. The populations\nin industrialized countries are ageing, and concern for the health of the older\nperson has grown accordingly. In contrast, the micronutrient needs of popu-\nlation groups in developing countries are still viewed in terms of millions\nexperiencing deﬁciency, and are then more appropriately deﬁned as those that\nwill satisfy basic nutritional needs of physically active younger populations.\nNevertheless, one also needs to bear in mind the double burden of under- and\novernutrition, which is growing rapidly in many developing countries.\nConcern has been raised about possible differences in micronutrient needs\nof populations with different lifestyles for a very practical reason. The logic\nbehind the establishment of micronutrient needs of industrialized nations has\ncome about at the same time as a large and growing demand for a wide variety\nof supplements and fortiﬁcants, and manufacturers have responded quickly\nto meet this market. This phenomenon could easily skew national strategies\nfor nutritional development, with an increased tendency to seek to resolve the\nmicronutrient deﬁciency problems of developing countries by promoting\nsupplements and fortiﬁcation strategies, rather than through increasing the\nconsumption of adequate and varied diets. Higher levels of RNIs often set in\ndeveloped countries can easily be supported because they can be met with\nsupplementation in addition to food which itself is often fortiﬁed. In contrast,\nit often becomes difﬁcult to meet some of the micronutrient needs in some\npopulations of developing countries by consuming locally available food,\nbecause foods are often seasonal, and neither supplementation nor fortiﬁca-\ntion reach vulnerable population groups.\nAmong the nutrients of greatest concern is calcium; the RNI may be\ndifﬁcult to meet in the absence of dairy products. The recently revised United\nStates/Canada dietary reference intakes (DRIs) propose only an acceptable\nintake (AI) for calcium instead of a recommended daily allowance (RDA) in\nrecognition of the fact that intake data are out of step",

Conversion factors for\ncarotenoids are under review, with the pending conclusion that servings of\ngreen leafy vegetables needed to meet vitamin A requirements probably need\nto be at least doubled. In view of this uncertainty, only “recommended safe\nintakes” rather than RNIs are provided for this vitamin.\nSelenium is the subject of growing interest because of its properties as an\nantioxidant. The RNIs recommended herein for this micronutrient are gen-\nerally lower than those derived by the United States Food and Nutrition\nBoard because the latter are calculated on a cellular basis, whereas the present\nreport relies on more traditional whole-body estimates.\nAre these “developments” or “new understandings” appropriate for and\napplicable in developing countries? The scientiﬁc evidence for answering this\nquestion is still emerging, but the time may be near when RNIs may need to\nbe deﬁned differently, taking into account the perspective of developing coun-\ntries based on developing country data.

Concepts, definitions and approaches\nused to define nutritional needs and\nrecommendations\n1.1 Introduction\nThe dietary requirement for a micronutrient is deﬁned as an intake level which\nmeets a speciﬁed criteria for adequacy, thereby minimizing risk of nutrient\ndeﬁcit or excess. These criteria cover a gradient of biological effects related to\na range of nutrient intakes which, at the extremes, include the intake required\nto prevent death associated with nutrient deﬁcit or excess. However, for nutri-\nents where insufﬁcient data on mortality are available, which is the case for\nmost micronutrients discussed in this report, other biological responses must\nbe deﬁned. These include clinical disease as determined by signs and symp-\ntoms of nutrient deﬁciency, and subclinical conditions identiﬁed by speciﬁc\nbiochemical and functional measures. Measures of nutrient stores or critical\ntissue pools may also be used to determine nutrient adequacy.\nFunctional assays are presently the most relevant indices of subclinical con-\nditions related to vitamin and mineral intakes. Ideally, these biomarkers\nshould be sensitive to changes in nutritional state while at the same time be\nspeciﬁc to the nutrient responsible for the subclinical deﬁciency. Often, the\nmost sensitive indicators are not the most speciﬁc; for example, plasma fer-\nritin, a sensitive indicator of iron status, may change not only in response to\niron supply, but also as a result of acute infection or chronic inﬂammatory\nprocesses. Similarly anaemia, the deﬁning marker of dietary iron deﬁciency,\nmay also result from, among other things, deﬁciencies in folate, vitamin B\nor copper.\nThe choice of criteria used to deﬁne requirements is of critical importance,\nsince the recommended nutrient intake to meet the deﬁned requirement will\nclearly vary, depending, among other factors, on the criterion used to deﬁne\nnutrient adequacy ( 1, 2, 3). Unfortunately, the information base to scientiﬁ-\ncally support the deﬁnition of nutritional needs across age ranges, sex and\nphysiologic states is limited for many nutrients.

However, requirement levels deﬁned using nutrient balance have\nbeen used if no other suitable data are available.\n1.2 Definition of terms\nThe following deﬁnitions relate to the micronutrient intake from food and\nwater required to promote optimal health, that is, prevent vitamin and mineral\ndeﬁciency and avoid the consequences of excess. Upper limits of nutrient\nintake are deﬁned for speciﬁc vitamins and minerals where there is a poten-\ntial problem with excess either from food or from food in combination with\nnutrient supplements.\n1.2.1 Estimated average requirement\nEstimated average requirement (EAR) is the average daily nutrient intake level\nthat meets the needs of 50% of the “healthy” individuals in a particular age\nand gender group. It is based on a given criteria of adequacy which will vary\ndepending on the speciﬁed nutrient. Therefore, estimation of requirement\nstarts by stating the criteria that will be used to deﬁne adequacy and then\nestablishing the necessary corrections for physiological and dietary factors.\nOnce a mean requirement value is obtained from a group of subjects, the\nnutrient intake is adjusted for interindividual variability to arrive at a\nrecommendation (4, 5, 6).\n1.2.2 Recommended nutrient intake\nRecommended nutrient intake (RNI) is the daily intake, set at the EAR plus\n2 standard deviations (SD), which meets the nutrient requirements of almost\nall apparently healthy individuals in an age- and sex-speciﬁc population\ngroup. If the distribution of requirement values is not known, a Gaussian or\nnormal distribution can be assumed, and from this it is expected that the mean\nrequirement plus 2 SD will cover the nutrient needs of 97.5% of the popula-\ntion. If the SD is not known, a value based on each nutrient’s physiology can\nbe used and in most cases a variation in the range of 10–12.5% can be assumed\n(exceptions are noted within relevant chapters).

ULs should be based on long-term exposure to all\nfoods, including fortiﬁed food products. For most nutrients no adverse effects\nare anticipated when they are consumed as foods because their absorption\nand/or excretion are regulated. The special situation of consumption of nutri-\ntional supplements which, when added to the nutrient intake from food, may\nresult in a total intake in excess of the UL is addressed for speciﬁc micronu-\ntrients in subsequent chapters, as appropriate. The ULs as presented here\ndo not meet the strict deﬁnition of the “no observed effect level” (NOEL)\nused in health risk assessment by toxicologists because in most cases, a\ndose–response curve for risk from exposure to a nutrient will not be available\n(8). For additional details on derivation of ULs, please refer to standard texts\non this subject ( 9, 10).\nThe range of intakes between the RNI and UL should be considered suf-\nﬁcient to prevent deﬁciency while avoiding toxicity.

The usual\nvalue for each uncertainty factor is 10, leading to a 10-fold reduction in the\nacceptable intake level for each of the considerations listed above. The reduc-\ntions may be used in isolation or in combination depending on the speciﬁc\nmicronutrient being assessed.\nModifying factors are additional uncertainty factors which have a value of\n1 or more but less than 10, and are based on expert judgement of the overall\nquality of the data available. Given the paucity of human data, the limitations\nof animal models and uncertainties of interpretation, the traditional toxico-\nlogical approach to determining limits for intake, as summarized here, may in\nfact lead to the deﬁnition of intakes which promote or even induce deﬁciency\nif followed by a population. This has recently been recognized by the WHO\nInternational Programme on Chemical Safety, and a special risk assessment\nmodel has been derived for elements that are both essential and have poten-\ntial toxicity (5, 9).\n1.2.7 Use of nutrient intake recommendations in population\nassessment\nRecommendations given in this report are generally presented as population\nRNIs with a corresponding UL where appropriate. They are not intended to\ndeﬁne the daily requirements of an individual.

It assumes that the variability of individual intakes is at least\nas large as the variability in requirements and that the distribution of intakes\nand requirements are independent of each other. The latter is most likely to\nbe true in the case of vitamins and minerals, but clearly not for energy. The\nEAR cut-point method requires a single population with a symmetrical dis-\ntribution around the mean. If these conditions are met, the prevalence of inad-\nequate intakes corresponds to the proportion of intakes that fall below the\nEAR. It is clearly inappropriate to examine mean values of population intake\nand RNI to deﬁne the population at risk of inadequacy. The relevant infor-\nmation is the proportion of intakes in a population group that is below the\nEAR, not below the RNI ( 4, 5).\nFigure 1.2 serves to illustrate the use of nutrient intake recommendations\nin risk assessment considering the model presented in Figure 1.1; the distribu-\ntions of nutrient intakes for a population have been added to explore risk of\nexcess or deﬁcit ( 2, 4, 5). Figure 1.2a presents the case of a single population\nwith intakes ranging from below the EAR to the UL with a mean intake close\nto the RNI. The fraction of the population that is below the EAR represents\nthe prevalence of deﬁcit; as depicted in the ﬁgure this is a sizeable group despite\nthe fact that the mean intake for the population is close to the RNI. Figure\n1.2b presents the case of a bimodal distribution of population intakes where\nthe conditions to use the EAR cut-point method are not met.

End-\npoints considered in recent investigations of essentiality of nutrients in exper-\nimental animals and humans include: reductions in ponderal or linear growth\nrates, altered body composition, compromised host defense systems, impair-\nment of gastrointestinal or immune function, abnormal cognitive perform-\nance, increased susceptibility to disease, increased morbidity and changes in\nbiochemical measures of nutrient status. To establish such criteria for partic-\nular vitamins and minerals requires a solid understanding of the biological\neffects of speciﬁc nutrients, as well as sensitive instrumentation to measure\nthe effects, and a full and precise knowledge of the amount and chemical form\nof nutrients supplied by various foods and their interactions ( 2, 12).\n1.3.2 Nutrient balance\nNutrient balance calculations typically involve assessing input and output and\nestablishing requirement at the point of equilibrium (except in the case of\nchildhood, pregnancy and lactation where the additional needs for growth,\ntissue deposition and milk secretion are considered). However, in most cases,\nbalance based on input–output measurements is greatly inﬂuenced by prior\nlevel of intake, that is, subjects adjust to high intakes by increasing output\nand, conversely, they lower output when intake is low. Thus, if sufﬁcient time\nis provided to accommodate to a given level of intake, balance can be achieved,\nand for this reason, the exclusive use of nutrient balance to deﬁne require-\nments should be avoided whenever possible ( 1, 5, 13).\nIn the absence of alternative sources of data, a starting point in deﬁning\nnutritional requirements using the balance methodology is the use of facto-\nrial estimates of nutritional need. The “factorial model” is based on measur-\ning the components that must be replaced when the intake of a speciﬁc\nnutrient is minimal or nil.

These are\nin fact the best criteria for deﬁning selenium needs without having to\nmeasure the key selenium dependent enzymes (i.e. liver or red blood cell\nglutathione peroxidase [GSHPx]) (28). In this case the measurement of suf-\nﬁciency is based on the GSHPx–mRNA response to selenium supply\nrather than measuring the enzymatic activity of the corresponding protein.\nMicro-array systems tailored to evaluate nutrient modulated expression of\nkey genes may become the most effective way of assessing human nutri-\ntional requirements in the future ( 29).\n1.3.4 Optimal intake\nOptimal intake is a relatively new approach to deriving nutrient requirements.\nThe question “Optimal intake for what?” is usually answered with the sug-\ngestion that a balanced diet or speciﬁc nutrients can improve physical and\nmental performance, enhance immunity, prevent cancer, or add healthy years\nto our life. This response is unfortunately often used too generally, and is\nusually unsupported by appropriate population-based controlled randomized\nstudies ( 15). The preferred approach to deﬁne optimal intake is to clearly\nestablish the function of interest and the level of desired function ( 30). The\nselected function should be related in a plausible manner to the speciﬁc nutri-\nent or food and serve to promote health or prevent disease.\nIf there is insufﬁcient information from which to derive recommendations\nbased on actual data using any of the approaches described above, the cus-\ntomary intake (based on an appropriate knowledge of food composition and\nfood consumption) of healthy populations becomes a reasonable default\napproach. Indeed, the presently recommended nutrient intakes for term\ninfants of several vitamins and minerals are based on this paradigm. Thus, the\nnutrient intake of the breast-fed infant becomes the relevant criteria since it\nis assumed that human milk is the optimal food for human growth and devel-\nopment.

The quantiﬁed RNI estimates\nderived from these various approaches may differ for one or more speciﬁc\nnutrients, but the effect of these numeric differences in establishing food-\nbased dietary guidelines for the general population is often of a lesser signif-\nicance (2, 12, 33).

RNIs provide the ﬁrm scientiﬁc\nbasis necessary to satisfy the requirements of a group of healthy individuals\nand deﬁne adequacy of diets.

In fact, single nutrient-based\napproaches have been of limited use in the establishment of nutritional and\ndietary priorities consistent with broad public health interests at the national\nand international levels ( 36).\nIn contrast to RNIs, food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) as instru-\nments of policy are more closely linked to diet–health relationships of\nrelevance to a particular country or region (12). FBDGs provide a broad per-\nspective that examines the totality of the effects of a given dietary pattern in\na given ecological setting, considering socioeconomic and cultural factors, and\nthe biological and physical environment, all of which affect the health and\nnutrition of a given population or community ( 2, 5).

Vitamin A\n2.1 Role of vitamin A in human metabolic processes\nVitamin A (retinol) is an essential nutrient needed in small amounts by\nhumans for the normal functioning of the visual system; growth and devel-\nopment; and maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune function,\nand reproduction. These dietary needs for vitamin A are normally provided\nfor as preformed retinol (mainly as retinyl ester) and provitamin A\ncarotenoids.\n2.1.1 Overview of vitamin A metabolism\nPreformed vitamin A in animal foods occurs as retinyl esters of fatty acids in\nassociation with membrane-bound cellular lipid and fat-containing storage\ncells. Provitamin A carotenoids in foods of vegetable origin are also associ-\nated with cellular lipids but are embedded in complex cellular structures such\nas the cellulose-containing matrix of chloroplasts or the pigment-containing\nportion of chromoplasts. Normal digestive processes free vitamin A and\ncarotenoids from food matrices, which is a more efﬁcient process from animal\nthan from vegetable tissues. Retinyl esters are hydrolysed and the retinol\nand freed carotenoids are incorporated into lipid-containing, water-miscible\nmicellar solutions. Products of fat digestion (e.g. fatty acids, monoglycerides,\ncholesterol, and phospholipids) and secretions in bile (e.g. bile salts and\nhydrolytic enzymes) are essential for the efﬁcient solubilization of retinol and\nespecially for solubilization of the very lipophilic carotenoids (e.g. a- and b-\ncarotene, b-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene) in the aqueous intestinal milieu.\nMicellar solubilization is a prerequisite to their efﬁcient passage into the lipid-\nrich membrane of intestinal mucosal cells (i.e. enterocytes) ( 1–3). Diets criti-\ncally low in dietary fat (under about 5–10g daily) ( 4) or disease conditions\nthat interfere with normal digestion and absorption leading to steatorrhoea\n(e.g. pancreatic and liver diseases and frequent gastroenteritis) can therefore\nimpede the efﬁcient absorption of retinol and carotenoids.

Some carotenoids pass into the enterocyte and are solubilized\ninto chylomicrons without further change whereas some of the provitamin A\ncarotenoids are converted to retinol by a cleavage enzyme in the brush border\n(3). Retinol is trapped intracellularly by re-esteriﬁcation or binding to\nspeciﬁc intracellular binding proteins. Retinyl esters and unconverted\ncarotenoids together with other lipids are incorporated into chylomicrons,\nexcreted into intestinal lymphatic channels, and delivered to the blood\nthrough the thoracic duct ( 2).\nTissues extract most lipids and some carotenoids from circulating chy-\nlomicrons, but most retinyl esters are stripped from the chylomicron remnant,\nhydrolysed, and taken up primarily by parenchymal liver cells. If not imme-\ndiately needed, retinol is re-esteriﬁed and retained in the fat-storing cells\nof the liver (variously called adipocytes, stellate cells, or Ito cells). The liver\nparenchymal cells also take in substantial amounts of carotenoids. Whereas\nmost of the body’s vitamin A reserve remains in the liver, carotenoids are\nalso deposited elsewhere in fatty tissues throughout the body ( 1). Usually,\nturnover of carotenoids in tissues is relatively slow, but in times of low dietary\ncarotenoid intake, stored carotenoids are mobilized. A recent study in one\nsubject using stable isotopes suggests that retinol can be derived not only from\nconversion of dietary provitamin carotenoids in enterocytes—the major site\nof bioconversion—but also from hepatic conversion of circulating provitamin\ncarotenoids (5). The quantitative contribution to vitamin A requirements of\ncarotenoid converted to retinoids beyond the enterocyte is unknown.\nFollowing hydrolysis of stored retinyl esters, retinol combines with\na plasma-speciﬁc transport protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP).

These bio-\nlogically active forms of vitamin A are associated with speciﬁc cellular\nproteins which bind with retinoids within cells during metabolism and with\nnuclear receptors that mediate retinoid action on the genome ( 9). Retinoids\nmodulate the transcription of several hundreds of genes ( 10–12). In addition\nto the latter role of retinoic acid, retinol is the form required for functions in\nthe visual (13) and reproductive systems (14) and during embryonic develop-\nment (15).\nHolo-RBP is ﬁltered into the glomerulus but recovered from the kidney\ntubule and recycled. Normally vitamin A leaves the body in urine only as\ninactive metabolites resulting from tissue utilization and in bile secretions as\npotentially recyclable active glucuronide conjugates of retinol ( 8). No single\nurinary metabolite has been identiﬁed which accurately reﬂects tissue levels\nof vitamin A or its rate of utilization. Hence, at this time urine is not a useful\nbiological ﬂuid for assessment of vitamin A nutriture.\n2.1.2 Biochemical mechanisms for vitamin A functions\nVitamin A functions at two levels in the body: the ﬁrst is in the visual cycle\nin the retina of the eye; the second is in all body tissues where it systemically\nmaintains the growth and soundness of cells. In the visual system, carrier-\nbound retinol is transported to ocular tissue and to the retina by intracellu-\nlar binding and transport proteins. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment critical to\ndim-light vision, is formed in rod cells after conversion of all- trans-retinol to\nretinaldehyde, isomerization to the 11- cis-form, and binding to opsin. Alter-\nation of rhodopsin through a cascade of photochemical reactions results in\nthe ability to see objects in dim light ( 13).

Classical symptoms of xerosis (drying or non-wetability)\nand desquamation of dead surface cells as seen in ocular tissue (i.e. xeroph-\nthalmia) are the external evidence of the changes also occurring to various\ndegrees in internal epithelial tissues.\nCurrent understanding of the mechanism of vitamin A action within cells\noutside the visual cycle is that cellular functions are mediated through spe-\nciﬁc nuclear receptors. Binding with speciﬁc isomers of retinoic acid (i.e. all-\ntrans- and 9- cis-retinoic acid) activates these receptors. Activated receptors\nbind to DNA response elements located upstream of speciﬁc genes to regu-\nlate the level of expression of those genes (12). These retinoid-activated genes\nregulate the synthesis of a large number of proteins vital to maintaining\nnormal physiologic functions.

In the context of varied cultural and community\nsettings, however, variations in gender-speciﬁc child-feeding and care prac-\ntices are likely to subsume a small sex differential in requirements to account\nfor reported sex differences in the prevalence of xerophthalmia. Pregnant and\nlactating women require additional vitamin A to support maternal and fetal\ntissue growth and lactation losses, additional vitamin A which is not needed\nby other post-adolescent adults ( 27).\n2.2.4 Risk factors\nVAD is most common in populations consuming most of their vitamin A\nneeds from provitamin carotenoid sources and where minimal dietary fat\nis available ( 28). About 90% of ingested preformed vitamin A is absorbed,\nwhereas the absorption efﬁciency of provitamin A carotenoids varies widely,\ndepending on the type of plant source and the fat content of the accompany-\ning meal ( 29). Where possible, an increased intake of dietary fat is likely to\nimprove the absorption of vitamin A in the body.\nIn areas with endemic VAD, ﬂuctuations in the incidence of VAD through-\nout the year reﬂect the balance between intake and need. Periods of general\nfood shortage (and speciﬁc shortages in vitamin A-rich foods) coincide with\npeak incidence of VAD and common childhood infectious diseases (e.g. diar-\nrhoea, respiratory infections, and measles).

Measles virus infection is especially devas-\ntating to vitamin A metabolism, adversely interfering with both efﬁciencies\nof utilization and conservation ( 42, 51, 52). Severe protein–energy malnutri-\ntion affects many aspects of vitamin A metabolism, and even when some\nretinyl ester stores are still present, malnutrition—often coupled with infec-\ntion—can prevent transport-protein synthesis, resulting in immobilization of\nexisting vitamin A stores ( 53).\nThe compromised integrity of the epithelium, together with the possible\nalteration in hormonal balance at severe levels of deﬁciency, impairs normal\nreproductive functions in animals ( 9, 14, 15, 24, 54, 55). Controlled human\nstudies are, of course, lacking. In animals and humans, congenital anomalies\ncan result if the fetus is exposed to severe deﬁciency or large excesses of\nvitamin A at critical periods early in gestation (ﬁrst trimester) when fetal\norgans are being formed (24, 56). Reproductive performance, as measured by\ninfant outcomes, in one community-based clinical intervention trial, however,\nwas not inﬂuenced by vitamin A status ( 43).\nThe growth of children may be impaired by VAD. Interventions with\nvitamin A only have not consistently demonstrated improved growth in\ncommunity studies because VAD seldom occurs in isolation from other\nnutrient deﬁciencies that also affect growth and may be more limiting ( 57).\nA lack of vitamin A can affect iron metabolism when deﬁciencies of both\nnutrients coexist and particularly in environments that favour frequent infec-\ntions (58).

Other researchers using a similar methodology have reported\nfactors from a variety of speciﬁc food sources that fall within this range.\nLowest bioavailability is reported for leafy green vegetables and raw carrots\nand highest for fruit/tuber diets ( 68, 73–75). In view of the data available to\ndate, conversion factors from usual mixed vegetable diets of 1:14 for b-\ncarotene and 1:28 for other provitamin A carotenoids as suggested by Van\nhet Hof et al.

Preformed vitamin A is also used to\nfortify processed foods, which may include sugar, cereals, condiments, fats,\nand oils ( 77). Provitamin A carotenoids are found in green leafy vegetables\n(e.g. spinach, amaranth, and young leaves from various sources), yellow veg-\netables (e.g. pumpkins, squash, and carrots), and yellow and orange non-citrus\nfruits (e.g. mangoes, apricots, and papayas). Red palm oil produced in several\ncountries worldwide is especially rich in provitamin A ( 78). Some other\nindigenous plants also may be unusually rich sources of provitamin A. Such\nexamples are the palm fruit known in Brazil as burití, found in areas along\nthe Amazon River (as well as elsewhere in Latin America) ( 79), and the fruit\nknown as gac in Viet Nam, which is used to colour rice, particularly on cere-\nmonial occasions ( 80). Foods containing provitamin A carotenoids tend to\nhave less biologically available vitamin A but are more affordable than animal\nproducts. It is mainly for this reason that carotenoids provide most of the\nvitamin A activity in the diets of economically deprived populations.\n2.4.2 Dietary intake and patterns\nAlthough vitamin A status cannot be assessed from dietary intake alone,\ndietary intake assessment can provide evidence of risk of an inadequate status.\nHowever, quantitative collection of dietary information is fraught with mea-\nsurement problems. These problems arise both from obtaining representative\nquantitative dietary histories from individuals, communities, or both, and\nfrom interpreting these data while accounting for differences in bioavailabil-\nity, preparation losses, and variations in food composition data among pop-\nulation groups (77). This is especially difﬁcult in populations consuming most\nof their dietary vitamin A from provitamin carotenoid sources.

World avail-\nability of vitamin A for human consumption at that time was approximately\n220mg of preformed retinol per capita per day and 560 mg RE from provita-\nmin carotenoids (about 3400 mg carotenoids for a 1:6 conversion factor) per\nperson per day, a total of about 790 mg RE. These values are based on supply\nestimates and not consumption estimates. Losses commonly occur during\nfood storage and processing, both industrially and in the home ( 77).\nThe estimated available regional supply of vitamin A from a more recent\nglobal evaluation shown in Table 2.2 illustrates the variability in amounts and\nsources of vitamin A. This variability is linked to access to the available supply\nof foods containing vitamin A, which varies with household income, with\npoverty being a yardstick for risk of VAD. VAD is most prevalent in South-\nEast Asia, Africa, and the Western Paciﬁc (Table 2.1), where vegetable sources\ncontribute nearly 80% or more of the available supply of retinol equivalents.\nFurthermore, in South-East Asia the total available supply is about half of\nthat of most other regions and is particularly low in animal sources.

However, these are rare occurrences\nthat require examination of large populations in order to obtain incidence and\nprevalence data. Subclinical VAD being the more prevalent requires smaller\nsample sizes for valid prevalence estimates ( 16).\nA full description of clinical indicators of VAD, with coloured illustrations\nfor each, can be found in the WHO ﬁeld guide ( 19). The most frequently\noccurring is night-blindness, which is the earliest manifestation of xeroph-\nthalmia. In its mild form it is generally noticeable after stress from a bright\nlight that bleaches the rhodopsin (visual purple) found in the retina. VAD pro-\nlongs the time to regenerate rhodopsin, and thus delays adaptation time in\ndark environments. Night-blind young children tend to stumble when going\nfrom bright to dimly-lit areas and they, as well as night-blind mothers, tend\nto remain inactive at dusk and at night ( 92).\nNo ﬁeld-applicable objective tool is currently available for measuring night-\nblindness in children under about 3 years of age.

In some developing countries, the vitamin A\nintake of breast-fed infants who grow well and do not show signs of deﬁ-\nciency ranges from 120 to 170 mg RE/day (25, 104).

Currently, there are no reliable\nﬁgures available for the speciﬁc vitamin A requirements for these processes\n(27).\nNewborn infants need around 100 mg of retinol daily to meet their needs\nfor growth. During the third trimester the fetus grows rapidly and, although\nobviously smaller in size than the infant born full term, the fetus presumably\nhas similar needs. Incremental maternal needs associated with pregnancy are\nassumed to be provided from maternal reserves in populations of adequately\nnourished healthy mothers. In populations consuming vitamin A at the basal\nrequirement, an additional increment of 100 mg/day during the full gestation\nperiod should enhance maternal storage during early pregnancy and allow for\nadequate amounts of vitamin A to be available for the rapidly growing fetus\nin late pregnancy. However, this increment may be minimal for women who\nnormally ingest only the basal requirement of vitamin A, inasmuch as the\nneeds and growth rate of the fetus will not be affected by the mother’s initial\nvitamin A reserves.\nA recent study in Nepal ( 43), where night-blindness is prevalent in preg-\nnant women, provided 7000 mg RE (about 23300IU) weekly to pregnant and\nlactating women (equivalent to 1000 mg RE/day). This level of intake nor-\nmalized serum levels of vitamin A and was associated with a decrease in preva-\nlence of night-blindness and a decrease in maternal mortality.

Vitamin D\n3.1 Role of vitamin D in human metabolic processes\nVitamin D is required to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phos-\nphate, which are in turn needed for the normal mineralization of bone, muscle\ncontraction, nerve conduction, and general cellular function in all cells of the\nbody. Vitamin D achieves this after its conversion to the active form 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)\n2D], or calcitriol. This active form regulates\nthe transcription of a number of vitamin D-dependent genes which code for\ncalcium-transporting proteins and bone matrix proteins.\nVitamin D also modulates the transcription of cell cycle proteins, which\ndecrease cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation of a number of spe-\ncialized cells of the body (e.g. osteoclastic precursors, enterocytes, ker-\natinocytes). This property may explain the actions of vitamin D in bone\nresorption, intestinal calcium transport, and skin. Vitamin D also possesses\nimmunomodulatory properties that may alter responses to infections in vivo.\nThese cell differentiating and immunomodulatory properties underlie the\nreason why vitamin D derivatives are now used successfully in the treatment\nof psoriasis and other skin disorders.\n3.1.1 Overview of vitamin D metabolism\nVitamin D, a seco-steroid, can either be made in the skin from a cholesterol-\nlike precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) by exposure to sunlight or can be pro-\nvided pre-formed in the diet ( 1). The version made in the skin is referred to\nas vitamin D\n3 whereas the dietary form can be vitamin D3 or a closely-related\nmolecule of plant origin known as vitamin D2 . Because vitamin D can be made\nin the skin, it should not strictly be called a vitamin, and some nutritional\ntexts refer to the substance as a prohormone and to the two forms as cole-\ncalciferol (D\n3) and ergocalciferol (D 2).\nFrom a nutritional perspective, the two forms are metabolized similarly\nin humans, are equal in potency, and can be considered equivalent. It is\nnow ﬁrmly established that vitamin D\n3 is metabolized ﬁrst in the liver to\n25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) ( 2",

The\n1,25-(OH)2D compound, like all vitamin D metabolites, is present in the\nblood complexed to the vitamin D-binding protein, a speciﬁc a-globulin. Cal-\ncitriol is believed to act on target cells in a similar way to a steroid hormone.\nFree hormone crosses the plasma membrane and interacts with a speciﬁc\nnuclear receptor known as the vitamin D receptor, a DNA-binding, zinc-\nﬁnger protein with a relative molecular mass of 55000 ( 4). This ligand-recep-\ntor complex binds to a speciﬁc vitamin D-responsive element and, with\nassociated transcription factors (e.g. retinoid X receptor), enhances transcrip-\ntion of mRNAs which code for calcium-transporting proteins, bone matrix\nproteins, or cell cycle-regulating proteins ( 5). As a result of these processes,\n1,25-(OH)\n2D stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and\nmobilizes calcium and phosphate by stimulating bone resorption ( 6). These\nfunctions serve the common purpose of restoring blood levels of calcium and\nphosphate to normal when concentrations of the two ions are low.\nLately, interest has focused on other cellular actions of calcitriol. With the\ndiscovery of 1,25-(OH)\n2D receptors in many classically non-target tissues\nsuch as brain, various bone marrow-derived cells, skin, and thymus ( 7), the\nview has been expressed that 1,25-(OH)2D induces fusion and differentiation\nof macrophages ( 8, 9). This effect has been widely interpreted to mean that\nthe natural role of 1,25-(OH) 2D is to induce osteoclastogenesis from colony\nforming units (i.e. granulatory monocytes in the bone marrow).

The\nresulting increase in 1,25-(OH) 2D (with the rise in PTH) causes an increase\nin calcium transport within the intestine, bone, and kidney. All these events\nraise plasma calcium levels back to normal, which in turn is sensed by the\ncalcium receptor of the parathyroid gland. The further secretion of PTH is\nturned off not only by the feedback action of calcium, but also by a short\nfeedback loop involving 1,25-(OH)\n2D directly suppressing PTH synthesis in\nthe parathyroid gland (not shown in Figure 3.1).\nAlthough this model oversimpliﬁes the events involved in calcium home-\nostasis, it clearly demonstrates that sufﬁcient 25-OH-D must be available\nto provide adequate 1,25-(OH)\n2D synthesis and hence an adequate level\nof plasma calcium; and similarly that vitamin D deﬁciency will result in\ninadequate 25-OH-D and 1,25-(OH)\n2D synthesis, inadequate calcium\nhomeostasis, and a constantly elevated PTH level (i.e. secondary\nhyperparathyroidism).\nIt becomes evident from this method of presentation of the role of vitamin\nD that the nutritionist can focus on the plasma levels of 25-OH-D and PTH\nto gain an insight into vitamin D status.

At birth, infants have acquired in utero the vitamin D stores that must\ncarry them through the ﬁrst months of life. A recent survey of French\nneonates revealed that 64% had 25-OH-D values below 30nmol/l, the lower\nlimit of the normal range ( 15). Breast-fed infants are particularly at risk\nbecause of the low concentrations of vitamin D in human milk ( 16). This\nproblem is further compounded in some infants fed human milk by a restric-\ntion in exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light for seasonal, latitudinal, cultural, or\nsocial reasons. Infants born in the autumn months at extreme latitudes are\nparticularly at risk because they spend the ﬁrst 6 months of their life indoors\nand therefore have little opportunity to synthesize vitamin D in their skin\nduring this period. Consequently, although vitamin D deﬁciency is rare in\ndeveloped countries, sporadic cases of rickets are still being reported in many\nnorthern cities but almost always in infants fed human milk ( 17–20).\nInfant formulas are supplemented with vitamin D at levels ranging from 40\ninternational units (IU) or 1mg/418.4kJ to 100IU or 2.5mg/418.4kJ, that\nprovide approximately between 6mg and 15mg of vitamin D, respectively.\nThese amounts of dietary vitamin D are sufﬁcient to prevent rickets.\n3.2.2 Adolescents\nAnother period of rapid growth of the skeleton occurs at puberty and\nincreases the need not for the vitamin D itself, but for the active form 1,25-\n(OH)\n2D. This need results from the increased conversion of 25-OH-D to\n1,25-(OH)2D in adolescents (21).

Not surprisingly, a number\nof independent studies from around the world have shown that there appears\nto be vitamin D deﬁciency in a subset of the elderly population, character-\nized by low blood levels of 25-OH-D coupled with elevations in plasma PTH\nand alkaline phosphatase (26). There is evidence that this vitamin D deﬁciency\ncontributes to declining bone mass and increases the incidence of hip frac-\ntures (27). Although some of these studies may exaggerate the extent of the\nproblem by focusing on institutionalized individuals or inpatients with\ndecreased sun exposures, in general they have forced health professionals to\nre-address the vitamin D intake of this segment of society and look at poten-\ntial solutions to correct the problem. Table 3.1 presents the ﬁndings of several\nstudies that found that modest increases in vitamin D intakes (between 10 and\n20mg/day) reduce the rate of bone loss and the incidence of hip fractures.\nThese ﬁndings have led several agencies and researchers to suggest an\nincrease in recommended vitamin D intakes for the elderly from 2.5–\n5mg/day to a value that is able to maintain normal 25-OH-D levels in the\nelderly, such as 10–15 mg/day. This vitamin D intake results in lower rates of\nbone loss and is proposed for the middle-aged (50–70 years) and old-aged\n(>70 years) populations (33).

Because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D, rare cases of\nnutritional rickets are still found, but these are almost always in breast-fed\ninfants deprived of sunlight exposure (17–20). Furthermore, there is little evi-\ndence that increasing calcium or vitamin D supplementation to lactating\nmothers results in an increased transfer of calcium or vitamin D in milk ( 38).\nThus, the current thinking, based on a clearer understanding of the role of\nvitamin D in lactation, is that there is little purpose in recommending addi-\ntional vitamin D for lactating women.

This\ndietary intake of vitamin D for each population group was rounded to the\nnearest 50IU (1.25 mg) and then doubled to cover the needs of all individuals\nwithin that group irrespective of sunlight exposure. This amount was termed\nadequate intake (AI) and was used in place of the recommended dietary\nallowance (RDA), which had been used by United States agencies since 1941.\nThe present Expert Consultation decided to use these ﬁgures as recommended\nnutrient intakes (RNIs) because it considered this to be an entirely logical\napproach to estimating the vitamin D needs for the global population.\nBecause many studies had recommended increases in vitamin D intakes for\nthe elderly, it might have been expected that the proposed increases in sug-\ngested intakes from 5mg/day (the RDA in the United States [43] and the RNI\nin Canada [ 44]) to between 10 and 15 mg/day (AI) would be welcomed.\nHowever, a recent editorial in a prominent medical journal attacked the rec-\nommendations as being too conservative ( 45).

In most situations, approx-\nimately 30 minutes of skin exposure (without sunscreen) of the arms and face\nto sunlight can provide all the daily vitamin D needs of the body ( 24).\nHowever, skin synthesis of vitamin D is negatively inﬂuenced by factors\nwhich may reduce the ability of the skin to provide the total needs of the indi-\nvidual (24):\n• latitude and season—both inﬂuence the amount of UV light reaching the skin;\n• the ageing process—thinning of the skin reduces the efﬁciency of this syn-\nthetic process;\n3.

There are some suggestions in the literature that these outbreaks\nof idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia may have involved genetic and dietary\ncomponents and were not due strictly to technical problems with over-\nfortiﬁcation as was assumed ( 49, 50).

This is all the more cause for concern because hypovitaminosis\nD is still a problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries, at high\nlatitudes and in countries where skin exposure to sunlight is discouraged (51).\n3.6 Recommendations for future research\nFurther research is needed to determine the following:\n• whether vitamin D supplements during pregnancy have any positive effects\nlater in life;\n• whether vitamin D has a role in lactation;\n• the long-term effects of high vitamin D intakes;\n• whether dietary vitamin D supplements are as good as exposure to UV\nlight;\n• whether vitamin D is only needed for regulation of calcium and phosphate.\nReferences\n1.

Calcium\n4.1 Introduction\nIt has been nearly 30 years since the last FAO/WHO recommendations on\ncalcium intake were published in 1974 ( 1) and nearly 40 years since the\nexperts’ meeting in Rome (2), on whose ﬁndings these recommendations were\nbased. During this time, a paradigm shift has occurred with respect to the\ninvolvement of calcium in the etiology of osteoporosis. The previous reports\nwere written against the background of the Albright paradigm ( 3), according\nto which osteomalacia and rickets were due to calcium deﬁciency, vitamin D\ndeﬁciency, or both, and osteoporosis was attributed to the failure of new bone\nformation secondary to negative nitrogen balance, osteoblast insufﬁciency, or\nboth. The rediscovery of earlier information that calcium deﬁciency led to the\ndevelopment of osteoporosis (not rickets and osteomalacia) in experimental\nanimals (4) resulted in a re-examination of osteoporosis in humans, notably\nin postmenopausal women. This re-examination yielded evidence in the late\n1960s that menopausal bone loss was not due to a decrease in bone formation\nbut rather to an increase in bone resorption ( 5–8); this has had a profound\neffect on our understanding of other forms of osteoporosis and has led to a\nnew paradigm that is still evolving.\nAlthough reduced bone formation may aggravate the bone loss process in\nelderly people ( 9) and probably plays a major role in corticosteroid osteo-\nporosis (10)—and possibly in osteoporosis in men ( 11)—bone resorption is\nincreasingly held responsible for osteoporosis in women and for the bone\ndeﬁcit associated with hip fractures in elderly people of both sexes ( 12).\nBecause bone resorption is also the mechanism whereby calcium deﬁciency\ndestroys bone, it is hardly surprising that the role of calcium in the patho-\ngenesis of osteoporosis has received increasing attention and that recom-\nmended calcium intakes have risen steadily in the past 35 years from the nadir\nwhich followed the publication of the report from the Rome meeting in 1962\n(13).

In the elementary\ncomposition of the human body, it ranks ﬁfth after oxygen, carbon, hydro-\ngen, and nitrogen, and it makes up 1.9% of the body by weight ( 18). Carcass\nanalyses show that calcium constitutes 0.1–0.2% of early fetal fat-free weight,\nrising to about 2% of adult fat-free weight. In absolute terms, this represents\na rise from about 24g (600mmol) at birth to 1300g (32.5mol) at maturity,\nrequiring an average daily positive calcium balance of 180mg (4.5mmol)\nduring the ﬁrst 20 years of growth (Figure 4.1).\nWB Min (g) (Mol) (g)\nWB Ca\n20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0\nAge (years)\nMales\nFemales\nSource: based on data supplied by Dr Zanchetta, Instituto de Investigaciones Metabolicas,\nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\nFIGURE 4.1\nWhole-body bone mineral (WB Min) (left axis) and whole-body calcium (WB Ca) (right\naxis) as a function of age as determined by total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\nP059-093 3/12/05 17:00 Page 60",

The\nremaining 1% is equally distributed between the teeth and soft tissues, with\nonly 0.1% in the extracellular ﬂuid (ECF). In the skeleton it constitutes 25%\nof the dry weight and 40% of the ash weight. The ECF contains ionized\ncalcium at concentrations of about 4.8mg/100ml (1.20mmol/l) maintained by\nthe parathyroid–vitamin D system as well as complexed calcium at concen-\ntrations of about 1.6mg/100ml (0.4mmol/l). In the plasma there is also a\nprotein-bound calcium fraction, which is present at a concentration of\n3.2mg/100ml (0.8mmol/l). In the cellular compartment, the total calcium\nconcentration is comparable with that in the ECF, but the free calcium con-\ncentration is lower by several orders of magnitude ( 19).\n4.3 Biological role of calcium\nCalcium salts provide rigidity to the skeleton and calcium ions play a role in\nmany, if not most, metabolic processes. In the primitive exoskeleton and in\nshells, rigidity is generally provided by calcium carbonate, but in the verte-\nbrate skeleton, it is provided by a form of calcium phosphate which approx-\nimates hydroxyapatite [Ca\n10(OH)2(PO4)6] and is embedded in collagen ﬁbrils.\nBone mineral serves as the ultimate reservoir for the calcium circulating in\nthe ECF. Calcium enters the ECF from the gastrointestinal tract by absorp-\ntion and from bone by resorption. Calcium leaves the ECF via the gastroin-\ntestinal tract, kidneys, and skin and enters into bone via bone formation\n(Figure 4.2). In addition, calcium ﬂuxes occur across all cell membranes. Many\nneuromuscular and other cellular functions depend on the maintenance of the\n4.

Calcium ﬂuxes are also important\nmediators of hormonal effects on target organs through several intracellular\nsignalling pathways, such as the phosphoinositide and cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate systems. The cytoplasmic calcium concentration is regulated\nby a series of calcium pumps, which either concentrate calcium ions within\nthe intracellular storage sites or extrude them from the cells (where they ﬂow\nin by diffusion). The physiology of calcium metabolism is primarily directed\ntowards the maintenance of the concentration of ionized calcium in the ECF.\nThis concentration is protected and maintained by a feedback loop through\ncalcium receptors in the parathyroid glands ( 20), which control the secretion\nof parathyroid hormone (see Figure 3.1). This hormone increases the renal\ntubular reabsorption of calcium, promotes intestinal calcium absorption by\nstimulating the renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol\n[1,25-(OH)\n2D], and, if necessary, resorbs bone. However, the integrity of the\nsystem depends critically on vitamin D status; if there is a deﬁciency of\nvitamin D, the loss of its calcaemic action (21) leads to a decrease in the ionized\ncalcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypophosphataemia. This is\nwhy experimental vitamin D deﬁciency results in rickets and osteomalacia\nwhereas calcium deﬁciency gives rise to osteoporosis ( 4, 22).\n4.4 Determinants of calcium balance\n4.4.1 Calcium intake\nIn a strictly operational sense, calcium balance is determined by the relation-\nship between calcium intake and calcium absorption and excretion. A strik-\ning feature of the system is that relatively small changes in calcium absorption\nand excretion can neutralize a high intake or compensate for a low one. There\nis a wide variation in calcium intake between countries, generally following\nthe animal protein intake and depending largely on dairy product consump-\ntion.

Thus, the faeces contain unabsorbed dietary calcium and\ndigestive juice calcium that was not reabsorbed (Figure 4.2).\nTrue absorbed calcium is the total amount of calcium absorbed from the\ncalcium pool in the intestines and therefore contains both dietary and diges-\ntive juice components. Net absorbed calcium is the difference between dietary\ncalcium and faecal calcium and is numerically the same as true absorbed\ncalcium minus endogenous faecal calcium. At zero calcium intake, all the\nfaecal calcium is endogenous and represents the digestive juice calcium which\nhas not been reabsorbed; net absorbed calcium at this intake is therefore neg-\native to the extent of about 200mg (5mmol) ( 28, 29). When the intake reaches\nabout 200mg (5mmol), dietary and faecal calcium become equal and net\nabsorbed calcium is zero. As calcium intake increases, net absorbed calcium\nalso increases, steeply at ﬁrst but then, as the active transport becomes satu-\nrated, more slowly until the slope of absorbed on ingested calcium approaches\nlinearity with an ultimate gradient of about 5–10% ( 24, 25, 30, 31). The\nrelationship between intestinal calcium absorption and calcium intake,\nderived from 210 balance experiments performed in 81 individuals collected\nfrom the literature ( 32–39), is shown in Figure 4.3.\nTrue absorption is an inverse function of calcium intake, falling from some\n70% at very low intakes to about 35% at high intakes (Figure 4.4). Percent-\nage net absorption is negative at low intake, becomes positive as intake\nincreases, reaches a peak of about 35% at an intake of about 400mg, and then\nfalls off as intake increases further.

However, there is\nalways a signiﬁcant obligatory loss of calcium in the urine (as there is in the\nfaeces), even on a low calcium intake, simply because maintenance of the\nplasma ionized calcium and, therefore, of the ﬁltered load, prevents total elim-\nination of calcium from the urine. The lower limit for urinary calcium in\ndeveloped countries is about 140mg (3.5mmol) but depends on protein and\nsalt intakes. From this obligatory minimum, urinary calcium increases on\nintake with a slope of about 5–10% ( 30, 31, 43).

Therefore, infants need\nto absorb some 120mg (3mmol) of calcium daily to allow for normal growth.\nWhat this represents in dietary terms can be calculated from calcium absorp-\ntion studies in newborn infants (52–56). These studies suggest that the absorp-\ntion of calcium from cow milk by infants is about 0.5 SD above the normal\nadult slope and from human milk is more than 1 SD above the normal adult\nslope. If this information is correct, different recommendations need to be\nmade for infants depending on milk source. With human milk, an absorption\nof 120mg (3mmol) of calcium requires a mean intake of 240mg (6mmol)\n(Figure 4.6) and a recommended intake of say 300mg (7.5mmol), which is\nclose to the amount provided in the average daily milk production of 750ml.\nWith cow milk, calcium intake needs to be about 300mg (7.5mmol) to meet\nthe requirement (Figure 4.6) and the recommended intake 400mg (10mmol)\n(Table 4.2).\n4.6.2 Children\nThe accumulation of whole-body calcium with skeletal growth is illustrated\nin Figure 4.1.

Even with the assumption of high calcium absorption ( +2\nSD), this requires an intake of 1040mg (26.0mmol) daily (Figure 4.6) and a\nrecommended intake of 1300mg (32.5mmol) during the peak growth phase\n(Table 4.2). It is difﬁcult to justify any difference between the allowances for\nboys and girls because, as mentioned above, although the growth spurt starts\nearlier in girls, it continues longer in boys. This recommended intake (which\nis close to that derived differently by Matkovic and Heaney [ 49, 58]) is not\nachieved by many adolescents even in developed countries ( 59–61), but the\neffects of this shortfall on their growth and bone status are unknown.\n4.6.4 Adults\nAs indicated earlier and for the reasons given, the Consultation concluded\nthat the mean apparent calcium requirement of adults in developed countries\nis about 520mg (13mmol) but that this is increased by insensible losses to\nsome 840mg (21mmol) (Figure 4.3). This reasoning forms the basis of the\nrecommended intake for adults of 1000mg (Table 4.2).\n4.6.5 Menopausal women\nThe most important single cause of osteoporosis—at least in developed coun-\ntries—is probably menopause, which is accompanied by an unequivocal and\nsustained rise in obligatory urinary calcium of about 30mg (0.75mmol) daily\n(50, 62, 63).

Calcium absorption tends to decrease with age in both\nsexes (67–69) but whereas there is strong evidence that calcium requirement\nrises during menopause, corresponding evidence about ageing men is less\nconvincing ( 32, 36). Nonetheless, as a precaution an extra allowance of\n300mg/day (7.5mmol/day) for men over 65 years to raise their requirement\nto that of postmenopausal women was proposed (Table 4.2).\n4.6.7 Pregnant women\nThe calcium content of the newborn infant is about 24g (600mmol). Most of\nthis calcium is laid down in the last trimester of pregnancy, during which\nthe fetus retains about 240mg (6mmol) of calcium daily ( 51). There is\nsome evidence that pregnancy is associated with an increase in calcium\nabsorption (associated with a rise in the plasma 1,25-(OH)\n2 D level) (70–72).\nFor a maternal urinary calcium of 120mg (3mmol) and a maternal skin loss\nof 60mg (1.5mmol), the absorbed calcium should be 420mg (10.5mmol)\ndaily. To achieve this optimal calcium absorption, the corresponding calcium\nintake would need to be at least 940mg (23.5mmol) (Figure 4.6).

It is increasingly thought that lactational\nbone loss is not a nutritional problem but may be due to the parathyroid\nhormone-related peptide secreted by the breast ( 79) and is therefore beyond\nthe control of dietary calcium. In view of this uncertainty, the present rec-\nommendations do not include any extra calcium allowance during lactation\n(Table 4.2); any risk to adolescent mothers is covered by the general recom-\nmendation of 1300mg for adolescents.\n4.7 Upper limits\nBecause of the inverse relationship between fractional calcium absorption and\ncalcium intake (Figure 4.4), a calcium supplement of 1000mg (25mmol) in\nconjunction with a Western-style diet only increases urinary calcium by about\n60mg (1.5mmol). Urinary calcium also rises very slowly with intake (slope\nof 5–10%) and the risk of kidney stones from dietary hypercalciuria must\ntherefore be negligible. In fact, it has been suggested that dietary calcium may\nprotect against renal calculi because it binds dietary oxalate and reduces\noxalate excretion ( 80, 81). Toxic effects of a high calcium intake have only\nbeen described when the calcium is given as the carbonate form in very high\ndoses; this toxicity is caused as much by the alkali as by the calcium and is\ndue to precipitation of calcium salts in renal tissue (milk-alkali syndrome)\n(82). However, in practice an upper limit on calcium intake of 3g (75mmol)\nis recommended.\n4.8 Comparisons with other recommendations\nThe current recommendations of the European Union, Australia, Canada/\nUnited States United States, and the United Kingdom are given in Table 4.3.\nThe present Expert Consultation’s recommendations for adults are very close\nto those of Canada and the United States but higher than those of Australia\nand the United Kingdom, which do not take into account insensible losses,\nand higher than those of the European Union, which assume 30% absorption\nof dietary calcium.

This was probably ﬁrst noted\nby Trotter ( 84) when she showed that bone density (weight/volume) was\nsigniﬁcantly higher in skeletons from black than from Caucasian subjects\nin the United States. It was later shown that hip fracture rates were lower\nin blacks than Caucasians in South Africa ( 85) and the United States\n(86). These observations have been repeatedly conﬁrmed ( 87, 88) without\nbeing fully explained but appear to be genetic in origin because the better\nbone status of Afro-Americans compared with Caucasians in the United\nStates is already apparent in childhood ( 89) and cannot be accounted for by\ndifferences in body size (90). Nor can the difference in fracture rates between\nthese two groups be explained by differences in hip axis length ( 90); it seems\nto be largely or wholly due to differences in bone density. Similarly, compar-\nisons between Caucasians and Samoans in New Zealand ( 91) have shown\nthe latter to have the higher bone densities. Asians have lower bone densities\nthan Caucasians in New Zealand but these differences are largely accounted\nfor by differences in body size ( 91). In the United States, fracture rates\nare lower among Asians than among Caucasians but this may be accounted\nfor by their shorter hip axis length ( 92) and their lower incidence of falls\n(93). Bone density is generally lower in Asians than Caucasians within\nthe United States ( 94) but again, this is largely accounted for by differences\nin body size ( 95). There are also lower hip fracture rates for Hispanics,\nChinese, Japanese and Koreans than Caucasians living in the United States\n(96, 97).

Until fairly recently, it\nwas widely assumed that low calcium intakes had no injurious consequences.\nThis view of the global situation underpinned the very conservative adequate\ncalcium intakes recommended by FAO/WHO in 1962 ( 2). At that time,\nosteoporosis was still regarded as a bone matrix disorder and the possibility\nthat it could be caused by calcium deﬁciency was barely considered.\nAs previously stated, the paradigm has since changed. Calcium deﬁciency\nis taken more seriously now and the apparent discrepancy between calcium\nintake and bone status worldwide has attracted considerable attention.\nHowever, with the exception of calcium deﬁciency rickets reported from\nNigeria (102), no satisfactory explanation has been found for the apparently\nlow prevalence of osteoporosis in developing countries on low calcium\nintakes; on international comparisons on a larger scale, it is very difﬁcult to\nseparate genetic from environmental factors. Nonetheless, certain patterns\nhave emerged which are likely to have biological signiﬁcance, the most\nstriking of which is the positive correlation between hip fracture rates\nand standard of living ﬁrst noted by Hegsted when he observed that osteo-\nporosis was largely a disease of afﬂuent industrialized cultures (103). He based\nthis conclusion on a previously published review of hip fracture rates in 10\ncountries (104) that strongly suggested a correlation between hip fracture rate\nand afﬂuence",

This could be explained if\nprotein actually increased calcium requirement (see section 4.10).\n4.9.4 The calcium paradox\nThe paradox that hip fracture rates are higher in developed countries\nwhere calcium intake is high than in developing countries where calcium\nintake is low probably has more than one explanation. Hegsted ( 103) was\nprobably the ﬁrst to note the close relationship between calcium and protein\nintakes across the world (which is also true within countries [ 63]) and to hint\nat, but dismiss, the possibility that the adverse effect of high protein intakes\nmight outweigh the positive effect of high calcium intakes on calcium balance.\nHe may have erred in dismissing this possibility since fracture risk has\nrecently been shown to be a function of protein intake in North American\nwomen ( 106). There is also suggestive evidence that hip fracture rates (as\njudged by mortality from falls in elderly people across the world) are a func-\ntion of protein intake, national income, and latitude ( 107). The latter associ-\nation is particularly interesting in view of the strong evidence of vitamin D\ndeﬁciency in hip fracture patients in the developed world ( 108–114) and the\nsuccessful prevention of such fractures with small doses of vitamin D and\ncalcium (115, 116) (see Chapter 3). It is therefore possible that hip fracture\nrates may be related to protein intake, vitamin D status, or both, and that\neither of these factors could explain the calcium paradox.\n4.10 Nutritional factors affecting calcium requirement\nThe calcium requirements proposed in Table 4.2 are based on data from devel-\noped countries (notably Norway and the United States) and can only be\napplied with any conﬁdence to countries and populations with similar dietary\ncultures. Other dietary cultures may entail different calcium requirements and\ncall for different recommendations.

Regarding the quantitative relationships between the renal handling\nof sodium and calcium, the ﬁltered load of sodium is about 100 times that of\ncalcium (in molar terms) but the clearance of these two elements is similar at\nabout 1ml/min, which yields about 99% reabsorption and 1% excretion for\nboth ( 118). However, these are approximations which conceal the close\ndependence of urinary sodium on sodium intake and the weaker dependence\nof urinary calcium on calcium intake. It is an empirical fact that urinary\nsodium and calcium are signiﬁcantly related in normal and hypercalciuric sub-\njects on freely chosen diets (119–122). The slope of urinary calcium on sodium\nvaries in published work from about 0.6% to 1.2% (in molar terms); a rep-\nresentative ﬁgure is about 1%, that is, 100mmol of sodium (2.3g) takes out\nabout 1mmol (40mg) of calcium ( 63, 120). The biological signiﬁcance of this\nrelationship is supported by the accelerated osteoporosis induced by feeding\nsalt to rats on low-calcium diets ( 123) and the effects of salt administration\nand salt restriction on markers of bone resorption in postmenopausal women\n(124, 125). Because salt restriction lowers urinary calcium, it is likely also to\nlower calcium requirement and, conversely, salt feeding is likely to increase\ncalcium requirement. This is illustrated in Figure 4.7, which shows that low-\nering sodium intake by 100mmol (2.3g) from, for example, 150 to 50mmol\n(3.45 to 1.15g), reduces the theoretical calcium requirement from 840mg\n(21mmol) to 600mg (15mmol).

One\nstudy found that 0.85mg of calcium was lost for each gram of protein in the\ndiet ( 130). A meta-analysis of 16 studies in 154 adult humans on protein\nintakes of up to 200g found that 1.2mg of calcium was lost in the urine for\nevery 1-g rise in dietary protein (131). A small but more focused study showed\na rise of 40mg in urinary calcium when dietary animal protein was raised from\n40 to 80g (i.e. within the physiological range) ( 132). This ratio of urinary\ncalcium to dietary protein (1mg to 1g) was adopted by the Expert Consulta-\ntion as a representative value. This means that a 40-g reduction in animal\nprotein intake from 60 to 20g (roughly the difference between the developed\nand developing regions shown in Table 4.1) would reduce calcium require-\nment by the same amount as a 2.3-g reduction in dietary sodium (i.e. from\n840 to 600mg) (Figure 4.7).\n4.

A rise in glomerular ﬁltration rate in response to protein has been\nsuggested as one factor (128) but this is unlikely to be important in the steady\nstate. The major mechanisms are thought to be the effect of the acid load con-\ntained in animal proteins and the complexing of calcium in the renal tubules\nby sulphate and phosphate ions released by protein metabolism ( 133, 134).\nUrinary calcium is signiﬁcantly related to urinary phosphate (as well as to\nurinary sodium), particularly in subjects on restricted calcium intakes or in\nthe fasting state, and most of the phosphorus in the urine of people on\nWestern-style diets comes from animal protein in the diet ( 63). Thus, the\nempirical observation that an intake of 1g of protein results in 1mg of calcium\nin the urine agrees very well with the phosphorus content of animal protein\n(about 1% by weight) and the observed relationship between calcium and\nphosphate in the urine ( 63).

It is now well\nestablished that vitamin D (synthesized in the skin under the inﬂuence of sun-\nlight) is converted to 25-OH-D in the liver and then to 1,25-(OH)\n2D in the\nkidneys and that the latter metabolite controls calcium absorption ( 21) (see\nChapter 3). However, plasma 25-OH-D closely reﬂects vitamin D nutritional\nstatus and because it is the substrate for the renal enzyme which produces\n1,25-(OH)\n2D, it could have an indirect effect on calcium absorption. The\nplasma level of 1,25-(OH)2D is principally regulated by gene expression of 1-\na-hydroxylase (CYP1a) and not by the plasma concentration of 25-OH-D.\nThis has been seen consistently in animal studies, and the high calcium absorp-\ntion (138) and high plasma concentrations of 1,25-(OH)\n2D (139) observed in\nGambian mothers are consistent with this type of adaptation. However,\nvitamin D synthesis may be compromised at high latitudes, to the degree that\n25-OH-D levels may not be sufﬁcient to sustain adequate 1,25-(OH)\n2D levels\nand efﬁcient intestinal calcium absorption—although this theory remains\nunproved.\nRegardless of the mechanism of compromised vitamin D homeostasis, the\ndifferences in calcium absorption efﬁciency have a major effect on theoreti-\ncal calcium requirement, as illustrated in Figure 4.8, which shows that an\nincrease in calcium absorption of as little as 10% reduces the intercept of\nexcreted and absorbed calcium (and therefore calcium requirement) from 840\nto 680mg.

Its\nnon-structural roles require the strict maintenance of ionized calcium\nconcentration in tissue ﬂuids at the expense of the skeleton if necessary and\nit is therefore the skeleton which is at risk if the supply of calcium falls short\nof the requirement.\nCalcium requirements are determined essentially by the relationship\nbetween absorptive efﬁciency and excretory rate—excretion being through\nthe bowel, kidneys, skin, hair, and nails. In adults, the rate of calcium absorp-\ntion from the gastrointestinal tract needs to match the rate of all losses from\nthe body if the skeleton is to be preserved; in children and adolescents, an\nextra input is needed to cover the requirements of skeletal growth.\nCompared with that of other minerals, calcium economy is relatively inef-\nﬁcient. On most intakes, only about 25–30% of dietary calcium is effectively\nabsorbed and obligatory calcium losses are relatively large. Dietary intake of\ncalcium has to be large enough to ensure that the rate of absorption matches\nobligatory losses if skeletal damage is to be avoided. The system is subject to\n4.

On the contrary,\nthere may be more osteoporosis in the world from other causes. Nonetheless,\nit would probably be agreed that any form of osteoporosis must inevitably\nbe aggravated by negative external calcium balance.

Vitamin E\n5.1 Role of vitamin E in human metabolic processes\nA large body of scientiﬁc evidence indicates that reactive free radicals are\ninvolved in many diseases, including heart disease and cancers ( 1). Cells\ncontain many potentially oxidizable substrates such as polyunsaturated fatty\nacids (PUFAs), proteins, and DNA. Therefore, a complex antioxidant defence\nsystem normally protects cells from the injurious effects of endogenously\nproduced free radicals as well as from species of exogenous origin such as cig-\narette smoke and pollutants. Should our exposure to free radicals exceed the\nprotective capacity of the antioxidant defence system, a phenomenon often\nreferred to as oxidative stress ( 2), then damage to biological molecules may\noccur. There is considerable evidence that disease causes an increase in oxida-\ntive stress; therefore, consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, which are\npotentially able to quench or neutralize excess radicals, may play an impor-\ntant role in modifying the development of disease.\nVitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the cell antioxidant\ndefence system and is exclusively obtained from the diet. The term “vitamin\nE” refers to a family of eight naturally-occurring homologues that are syn-\nthesized by plants from homogentisic acid. All are derivatives of 6-chromanol\nand differ in the number and position of methyl groups on the ring structure.\nThe four tocopherol homologues (d-a-, d-b-, d-g-, and d-d-) have a saturated\n16-carbon phytyl side chain, whereas the four tocotrienols ( d-a-, d-b-, d-g-,\nand d-d-) have three double bonds on the side chain. There is also a widely\navailable synthetic form, dl-a-tocopherol, prepared by coupling trimethyl-\nhydroquinone with isophytol. This consists of a mixture of eight stereoiso-\nmers in approximately equal amounts; these isomers are differentiated by\nrotations of the phytyl chain in various directions that do not occur naturally.\nFor dietary purposes, vitamin E activity is expressed as a-tocopherol equiv-\nalents (a-TEs). One a-TE is the activity of 1mg RRR-a-tocopherol (d-a-toco-\npherol). To estimate the",

One milligram\nof the latter compound in the acetate form is equivalent to 1IU of vitamin E.\nVitamin E is an example of a phenolic antioxidant. Such molecules readily\ndonate the hydrogen from the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the ring structure\nto free radicals, making them unreactive. On donating the hydrogen, the phe-\nnolic compound itself becomes a relatively unreactive free radical because the\nunpaired electron on the oxygen atom is usually delocalized into the aromatic\nring structure thereby increasing its stability ( 3).\nThe major biological role of vitamin E is to protect PUFAs and other com-\nponents of cell membranes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxida-\ntion by free radicals. Vitamin E is located primarily within the phospholipid\nbilayer of cell membranes. It is particularly effective in preventing lipid per-\noxidation—a series of chemical reactions involving the oxidative deterioration\nof PUFAs (see Chapter 8 on antioxidants). Elevated levels of lipid peroxida-\ntion products are associated with numerous diseases and clinical conditions\n(4). Although vitamin E is primarily located in cell and organelle membranes\nwhere it can exert its maximum protective effect, its concentration may only\nbe one molecule for every 2000 phospholipid molecules. This suggests that\nafter its reaction with free radicals it is rapidly regenerated, possibly by other\nantioxidants (5).\nAbsorption of vitamin E from the intestine depends on adequate pancreatic\nfunction, biliary secretion, and micelle formation. Conditions for absorption\nare like those for dietary lipid, that is, efﬁcient emulsiﬁcation, solubilization\nwithin mixed bile salt micelles, uptake by enterocytes, and secretion into the\ncirculation via the lymphatic system (6). Emulsiﬁcation takes place initially in\nthe stomach and then in the small intestine in the presence of pancreatic and\nbiliary secretions. The resulting mixed micelle aggregates the vitamin E mol-\necules, solubilizes the vitamin E, and then transports it to the brush border\nmembrane of the enterocyte, probably by passive diffusion.

Chylomicrons carry tocopherol from the enterocyte to the liver,\nwhere they are incorporated into parenchymal cells as chylomicron remnants.\nThe catabolism of chylomicrons takes place in the systemic circulation\nthrough the action of cellular lipoprotein, lipase. During this process toco-\npherol can be transferred to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). The toco-\npherol in HDLs can transfer to other circulating lipoproteins, such as LDLs\n5.

During the conversion of\nVLDL to LDL in the circulation, some a-tocopherol remains within the core\nlipids and is thus incorporated in LDL. Most a-tocopherol then enters the\ncells of peripheral tissues within the intact lipoprotein through the LDL\nreceptor pathway, although some may be taken up by membrane binding sites\nrecognizing apolipoprotein A-I and A-II present on HDL ( 8).\nAlthough the process of absorption of all the tocopherol homologues in\nthe diet is similar, the a form predominates in blood and tissue. This is due\nto the action of binding proteins that preferentially select the a form over\nother forms. In the ﬁrst instance, a 30-kDa binding protein unique to the liver\ncytoplasm preferentially incorporates a-tocopherol in the nascent VLDL (9).\nThis form also accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, particularly at sites where\nfree radical production is greatest, such as in the membranes of mitochondria\nand endoplasmic reticulum in the heart and lungs ( 10).\nHepatic intracellular transport may be expedited by a 14.2-kDa binding\nprotein that binds a-tocopherol in preference to the other homologues ( 11).\nOther proteinaceous sites with apparent tocopherol-binding abilities have\nbeen found on erythrocytes, adrenal membranes, and smooth muscle cells\n(12). These may serve as vitamin E receptors which orient the molecule within\nthe membrane for optimum antioxidant function.\nThese selective mechanisms explain why vitamin E homologues have\nmarkedly differing antioxidant abilities in biological systems and they illus-\ntrate the important distinction between the in vitro antioxidant effectiveness\nof a substance in the stabilization of, for example, a food product and its in\nvivo potency as an antioxidant. From a nutritional perspective, the most\nimportant form of vitamin E is a-tocopherol; this is corroborated in animal\nmodel tests of biopotency which assess the ability of the various homologues\nto prevent fetal absorption and muscular dystrophies (Table 5.1).\nPlasma vitamin E concentrations vary little over a wide range of dietary\nintakes.

Kinetic studies with deuterated tocopherol (15) suggest that there is rapid\nequilibration of new tocopherol in erythrocytes, liver, and spleen but that\nturnover in other tissues such as heart, muscle, and adipose tissue is much\nslower.

This glucuronide is excreted in the bile as such or further\ndegraded in the kidneys to a-tocopheronic acid glucuronide and hence\nexcreted in the bile. Those vitamin E homologues not preferentially selected\nby the hepatic binding proteins are eliminated during the process of nascent\nVLDL secretion in the liver and probably excreted via the bile ( 17). Some\nvitamin E may also be excreted via skin sebaceous glands ( 18).\n5.2 Populations at risk for vitamin E deficiency\nThere are many signs of vitamin E deﬁciency in animals, most of which are\nrelated to damage to cell membranes and leakage of cell contents to external\nﬂuids. Disorders provoked by traces of peroxidized PUFAs in the diets of\nanimals with low vitamin E status include cardiac or skeletal myopathies, neu-\nropathies, and liver necrosis ( 19) (Table 5.2). Muscle and neurological prob-\nlems are also a consequence of human vitamin E deﬁciency ( 20). Early\ndiagnostic signs of deﬁciency include leakage of muscle enzymes such as cre-\natine kinase and pyruvate kinase into plasma, increased levels of lipid perox-\nidation products in plasma, and increased erythrocyte haemolysis.\nThe assessment of the vitamin E requirement for humans is confounded\nby the very rare occurrence of clinical signs of deﬁciency because these usually\nonly develop in infants and adults with fat-malabsorption syndromes or liver\ndisease, in individuals with genetic anomalies in transport or binding proteins,\nand possibly in premature infants ( 19, 21).

It is thought that oxidized lipoprotein is a key event in the\ndevelopment of the atheromatous plaque, which may ultimately occlude the\nblood vessel (23).\nHuman studies, however, have been less consistent in providing evidence\nfor a role of vitamin E in preventing heart disease. Vitamin E supplements\nreduce ex vivo oxidizability of plasma LDLs but there is no correlation\nbetween ex vivo lipoprotein oxidizability and endogenous vitamin E levels in\nan unsupplemented population ( 24). Similarly, the few randomized double\nblind placebo-controlled intervention trials conducted to date with human\nvolunteers, which focused on the relationship between vitamin E and cardio-\nvascular disease, have yielded inconsistent results.

( 28) reported that lipid-standardized\nplasma vitamin E concentrations in middle-aged men across 16 European\ncountries predicted 62% of the variance in the mortality from ischaemic heart\ndisease. In the United States both the Nurses Health Study ( 29), which\ninvolved 87000 females in an 8-year follow-up, and the Health Professionals\nFollow-up Study of 40000 men ( 30) concluded that persons taking supple-\nments of 100mg/day or more of vitamin E for at least 2 years had approxi-\nmately a 40% lower incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular\nmortality than those who did not. However, there was no inﬂuence of dietary\nvitamin E alone on incidence of cardiovascular disease when those taking sup-\nplements were removed from the analyses. A possible explanation for the sig-\nniﬁcant relationship between dietary vitamin E and cardiovascular disease in\nEuropean countries but not in the United States may be found in the fact that\nacross Europe populations consume foods with widely differing amounts of\nvitamin E. Sunﬂower seed oil, which is rich in a-tocopherol, tends to be con-\nsumed more widely in the southern European countries where a lower inci-\ndence of cardiovascular disease is reported, than in northern European\ncountries where soybean oil, which contains more of the g form, is preferred\n(31) (Table 5.3). A study carried out which compared plasma a-tocopherol\nand g-tocopherol concentrations in middle-aged men and women in Toulouse\n(southern France) with Belfast (Northern Ireland) found that the concentra-\ntions of g-tocopherol in Belfast were twice as high as those in Toulouse; a-\ntocopherol concentrations were identical in men in both countries but higher\nin women in Belfast than in Toulouse ( P < 0.001) (32).\nIt has also been suggested that vitamin E supplementation (200–\n400mg/day) may be appropriate therapeutically to moderate some aspects of\ndegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, reduce the severity of neu-\nrologic disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, prevent periventricular",

Exceptions may be during ecologic disasters and cultural conﬂicts\nresulting in food deprivation and famine.\nAnalysis of the FAO country food balance sheets indicates that about half\nthe a-tocopherol in a typical northern European diet, such as in the United\nKingdom, is derived from vegetable oils ( 31). Animal fats, vegetables, and\nmeats each contribute about 10% to the total per capita supply and fruit, nuts,\ncereals, and dairy products each contribute about 4%. Eggs, ﬁsh, and pulses\ncontribute less than 2% each.\nThere are marked differences in per capita a-tocopherol supply among\ndifferent countries ranging from approximately 8–10mg/person/day (e.g.\nFinland, Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand) to 20–25mg/person/day (e.g.\nFrance, Greece, and Spain) ( 31). This variation can be ascribed mainly to the\ntype and quantity of dietary oils used in different countries and the propor-\ntion of the different homologues in the oils (Table 5.4). For example, sun-\nﬂower seed oil contains approximately 55mg a-tocopherol/100g in contrast\nto soybean oil that contains only 8mg/100ml ( 36).\nTABLE 5.3\nCross-country correlations between coronary heart\ndisease mortality in men and the supply of vitamin\nE homologues across 24 European countries\nHomologue Correlation coefﬁcient, r\nTotal vitamin E -0.386\nd-a-tocopherol -0.753a\nd-b-tocopherol -0.345\nd-g-tocopherol -0.001\nd-d-tocopherol 0.098\nd-a-tocotrienol -0.072\nd-b-tocotrienol -0.329\nd-g-tocotrienol -0.210\na The correlation with d-a-tocopherol is highly signiﬁcant ( P < 0.001)\nwhere",

Despite its important biological antioxidant\nproperties, there is no consistent evidence that supplementing the diet with\nvitamin E protects against chronic disease. The main function of vitamin E,\nwhich appears to be that of preventing oxidation of PUFAs, has nevertheless\nbeen used by the present Consultation as the basis for proposing RNIs for\nvitamin E because of the considerable evidence in different animal species that\nlow levels of vitamin E combined with an excess of PUFAs give rise to a wide\nvariety of clinical signs.\nThere is very little clinical evidence of deﬁciency disease in humans except\nin certain inherited conditions where the metabolism of vitamin E is dis-\nturbed. Even biochemical evidence of poor vitamin E status in both adults\nand children is minimal. Meta-analysis of data collected within European\ncountries indicates that optimum intakes may be implied when plasma con-\ncentrations of vitamin E exceed 25–30 mmol/l of lipid-standardized a-\ntocopherol (37). However, this approach should be treated with caution, as\nplasma vitamin E concentrations do not necessarily reﬂect intakes or tissue\nreserves because only 1% of the body tocopherol may be in the blood ( 38)\nand the amount in the circulation is strongly inﬂuenced by circulating\nlipid (39); nevertheless, a lipid-standardized vitamin E concentration (e.g. a\ntocopherol–cholesterol ratio) greater than 2.25 (calculated as mmol/mmol) is\nbelieved to represent satisfactory vitamin E status ( 38, 39).

However, the development of clinical evidence of vitamin E\ndeﬁciency (e.g. muscle damage or neurologic lesions) can take several years\nof exposure to extremely low vitamin E levels ( 41).\nDietary intakes of PUFAs have been used to assess the adequacy of vitamin\nE intakes by United States and United Kingdom advisory bodies. PUFAs are\nvery susceptible to oxidation and their increased intake, without a concomi-\ntant increase in vitamin E, can lead to a reduction in plasma vitamin E con-\ncentrations ( 42) and to elevations in some indexes of oxidative damage in\nhuman volunteers (43). However, diets high in PUFAs tend also to be high in\nvitamin E, and to set a dietary recommendation based on extremes of PUFA\nintake would deviate considerably from median intakes of vitamin E in most\npopulations of industrialized countries. Hence ‘safe’ allowances for the United\nKingdom (men 10 and women 7mg/day) ( 44) and ‘arbitrary’ allowances for\nthe United States (men 10 and women 8mg/day) ( 45) for vitamin E intakes\napproximate the median intake in those countries. It is worth noting that only\n11 (0.7%) out of 1629 adults in the 1986–1987 British Nutrition Survey had a-\ntocopherol–cholesterol ratios <2.25. Furthermore, although the high intake of\nsoybean oil, with its high content of g-tocopherol, substitutes for the intake of\na-tocopherol in the British diet, a comparison of a-tocopherol–cholesterol\nratios found almost identical results in two groups of randomly-selected,\nmiddle-aged adults in Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Toulouse (France), two\ncountries with very different intakes of a-tocopherol (36) and cardiovascular\nrisk (32).\nIt has been suggested that when the main PUFA in the diet is linoleic acid,\na d-a-tocopherol–PUFA ratio of 0.4 (expressed as mg tocopherol per g\nPUFA) is adequate for adult humans ( 46, 47).

As indicated above, however, plasma concentra-\ntions of a-tocopherol in subjects from Toulouse and Belfast suggest that an\nincreased amount of dietary vitamin E is not necessary to maintain satisfac-\ntory plasma concentrations ( 32).\nAt present, data are not sufﬁcient to formulate recommendations for\nvitamin E intake for different age groups except for infancy. There is some\nindication that newborn infants, particularly if born prematurely, are vulner-\nable to oxidative stress because of low body stores of vitamin E, impaired\nabsorption, and reduced transport capacity resulting from low concentrations\nof circulating low-density lipoproteins at birth ( 51). However, term infants\nnearly achieve adult plasma vitamin E concentrations in the ﬁrst week ( 52)\nand although the concentration of vitamin E in early human milk can be vari-\nable, after 12 days it remains fairly constant at 0.32mg a-TE/100ml milk (53).\nThus a human-milk-fed infant consuming 850ml would have an intake of\n2.7mg a-TE. It seems reasonable that formula milk should not contain\nless than 0.3mg a-TE/100ml of reconstituted feed and not less than 0.4mg\na-TE/g PUFA.\nNo speciﬁc recommendations concerning the vitamin E requirements in\npregnancy and lactation have been made by other advisory bodies ( 44, 45)\nmainly because there is no evidence of vitamin E requirements different from\nthose of other adults and, presumably, also because the increased energy\nintake during these periods would compensate for the increased needs for\ninfant growth and milk synthesis.\n5.5 Toxicity\nVitamin E appears to have very low toxicity, and amounts of 100–200mg of\nthe synthetic all- rac-a-tocopherol are consumed widely as supplements ( 29,\n30).

Vitamin K\n6.1 Introduction\nVitamin K is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient, which is needed for a\nunique post-translational chemical modiﬁcation in a small group of proteins\nwith calcium-binding properties, collectively known as vitamin K-dependent\nproteins or Gla proteins. Thus far, the only unequivocal role of vitamin K\nin health is in the maintenance of normal coagulation. The vitamin K-\ndependent coagulation proteins are synthesized in the liver and comprise\nfactors II, VII, IX, and X, which have a haemostatic role (i.e. they are proco-\nagulants that arrest and prevent bleeding), and proteins C and S, which have\nan anticoagulant role (i.e. they inhibit the clotting process). Despite this\nduality of function, the overriding effect of nutritional vitamin K deﬁciency\nis a bleeding tendency caused by the relative inactivity of the procoagulant\nproteins. Vitamin K-dependent proteins synthesized by other tissues include\nthe bone protein osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, though their functions\nremain to be clariﬁed.\n6.2 Biological role of vitamin K\nVitamin K is the family name for a series of fat-soluble compounds which\nhave a common 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone nucleus but differ in the struc-\ntures of a side chain at the 3-position. They are synthesized by plants and bac-\nteria. In plants the only important molecular form is phylloquinone (vitamin\nK\n1), which has a phytyl side chain. Bacteria synthesize a family of compounds\ncalled menaquinones (vitamin K2), which have side chains based on repeating\nunsaturated 5-carbon (prenyl) units. These are designated menaquinone-n\n(MK-n) according to the number (n) of prenyl units. Some bacteria also syn-\nthesize menaquinones in which one or more of the double bonds is saturated.\nThe compound 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (common name menadione)\nmay be regarded as a provitamin because vertebrates can convert it to MK-4\nby adding a 4-prenyl side chain at the 3-position.\nThe",

The function of protein C is to degrade phospho-\nlipid-bound activated factors V and VIII in the presence of calcium. Protein\nS acts as a synergistic cofactor to protein C by enhancing the binding of acti-\nvated protein C to negatively charged phospholipids. There is evidence that\nprotein S is synthesized by several tissues including the blood vessel wall and\nbone and may have other functions besides its well-established role as a coag-\nulation inhibitor. Yet another vitamin K-dependent plasma protein (protein\nZ) is suspected to have a haemostatic role but its function is currently\nunknown.\nApart from the coagulation proteins, several other vitamin K-dependent\nproteins have been isolated from bone, cartilage, kidney, lungs, and other\ntissues ( 4, 5). Only two, osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein (MGP), have\nbeen well characterized. Both are found in bone but MGP also occurs in\ncartilage, blood vessel walls, and other soft tissues. It seems likely that one\nfunction of MGP is to inhibit mineralization ( 6). Thus far, no clear biologi-\ncal role for osteocalcin has been established despite its being the major non-\ncollagenous bone protein synthesized by osteoblasts ( 7–9). This failure to\nestablish a biological function for osteocalcin has hampered studies of the pos-\nsible detrimental effects of vitamin K deﬁciency on bone health.

After an overnight fast, more\nthan half of the circulating phylloquinone is still associated with triglyceride-\nrich lipoproteins, with the remainder being equally distributed between\nlow-density and high-density lipoproteins ( 13).

Although phylloquinone in blood must have been derived\nexclusively from the diet, it is not known whether circulating menaquinones\nsuch as MK-7 are derived from the diet, intestinal ﬂora, or a combination of\nthese sources.\n6.3.2 Tissue stores and distribution\nUntil the 1970s, the liver was the only known site of synthesis of vitamin K-\ndependent proteins and hence was presumed to be the only signiﬁcant storage\nsite for the vitamin. However, the discovery of vitamin K-dependent\nprocesses and proteins in a number of extra-hepatic tissues suggests that this\nmay not be the case (see section 6.2).\nHuman liver stores normally comprise about 90% menaquinones and 10%\nphylloquinone (14, 15). There is evidence that the phylloquinone liver stores\nare very labile; under conditions of severe dietary depletion, liver concentra-\ntions were reduced to about 25% of their initial levels after only 3 days ( 15).\nThis high turnover of hepatic reserves of phylloquinone is in accord with the\nhigh losses of this vitamer through excretion ( 10).\nKnowledge of hepatic stores of phylloquinone in different population\ngroups is limited. Adult hepatic stores in a United Kingdom study were about\n11pmol/g (14) whereas in a study from Japan they were about two-fold higher\n(15). Such reserves are about 20000–40000-fold lower than those for retinol\nfor relative daily intakes of phylloquinone that are only about 10-fold lower\nthan those of vitamin A ( 16).\nThe relationship between hepatic and total-body stores of vitamin K is not\nknown. Other sites of storage may be adipose tissue and bone; both are\nknown to be sites where vitamin K-bearing chylomicrons and chylomicron\nremnants may be taken up.

It has been reported that the predominant vitamer\nin human cortical and trabecular bone is phylloquinone; unlike the situation\nin liver, no menaquinones higher than MK-8 were detected ( 17).\nIn contrast to the hepatic preponderance of long-chain menaquinones,\nthe major circulating form of vitamin K is invariably phylloquinone. The\nmenaquinones MK-7, and possibly MK-8, are also present but the common\nhepatic forms, MKs 9–13, are not detectable in blood plasma ( 16, 18). This\nmay be a consequence of a different route of absorption (e.g. the possibility\nof a portal route for long-chain MKs versus the established lymphatic route\nfor phylloquinone), but might also suggest that once in the liver, the lipophilic\nlong-chain menaquinones are not easily mobilized ( 16, 18, 19).\n6.

    "text": "6.3.3 Bioactivity\nVery little information exists on the relative effectiveness of the different\nhepatic forms of K vitamins with respect to the coagulation function of\nvitamin K in humans. This information is important because of the prepon-\nderance of long-chain menaquinones in human liver. Early bioassay data from\nrats suggested that long-chain menaquinones (MK-7, -9, and -10) were more\nefﬁcient than phylloquinone in reversing vitamin K deﬁciency when single\ndoses were given parenterally and that their sustained effect on vitamin K\nstatus may be due to their slower hepatic turnover ( 18, 19). Groenen-van\nDooren et al. (20) also observed a longer duration of the biological response\nof MK-9 compared with phylloquinone in vitamin K-deﬁcient rats. On the\nother hand, Will and Suttie ( 21) showed that when given orally, the dietary\nrequirement for MK-9 for the maintenance of prothrombin synthesis in rats\nis higher than that for phylloquinone. They also reported that the initial\nhepatic turnover of MK-9 was two- to three-fold slower than that of\nphylloquinone.\nSuttie (18) emphasized that the existence of a large pool of menaquinones\nin human liver does not necessarily mean that menaquinones make a propor-\ntionately greater contribution to the maintenance of vitamin K sufﬁciency.\nIn humans, however, the development of subclinical signs of vitamin K deﬁ-\nciency detected in dietary phylloquinone restriction studies argues against\nthis, especially when placed alongside the lack of change of hepatic\nmenaquinone stores ( 15). One explanation is that many of the hepatic\nmenaquinones are not biologically available to the microsomal g-glutamyl car-\nboxylase because of their different subcellular location; for instance, they may\nbe located in the mitochondria and possibly other non-microsomal sites (18).\n6.3.4 Excretion\nVitamin K is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine\nand bile.

The deﬁciency syndrome is traditionally known as haemorrhagic disease\nof the newborn. More recently, in order to give a better deﬁnition of the cause,\nit has been termed vitamin K deﬁciency bleeding (VKDB).\nThe time of onset of VKDB is now thought to be more unpredictable than\npreviously supposed; currently three distinct syndromes are recognized:\nearly, classic, and late VKDB (Table 6.1). Until the 1960s, VKDB was con-\nsidered to be solely a problem of the ﬁrst week of life. Then, in 1966, came\nthe ﬁrst reports from Thailand of a new vitamin K deﬁciency syndrome that\ntypically presented between 1 and 2 months of life and which is now termed\nlate VKDB.

More reports from south-east\nAsia and Australia followed, and in 1983 McNinch et al. ( 25) reported the\nreturn of VKDB in the United Kingdom. This increased incidence was\nascribed to a decrease in the practice of vitamin K prophylaxis and to an\nincreased trend towards exclusive human-milk feeding ( 25).\nWithout vitamin K prophylaxis, the incidence of late VKDB (per 100000\nbirths), based on acceptable surveillance data, has been estimated to be 4.4 in\nthe United Kingdom, 7.2 in Germany, and as high as 72 in Thailand ( 26). Of\nreal concern is that late VKDB, unlike the classic form, has a high incidence\nof death or severe and permanent brain damage resulting from intracranial\nhaemorrhage (19, 22, 23).\nEpidemiological studies worldwide have identiﬁed two major risk factors\nfor both classic and late VKDB: exclusive human-milk feeding and the failure\nto give any vitamin K prophylaxis ( 19, 22, 23). The increased risk for infants\nfed human milk compared with formula milk is probably related to the rela-\ntively low concentrations of vitamin K (phylloquinone) in breast milk com-\npared with formula milks ( 27–29). For classic VKDB, studies using the\ndetection of under-carboxylated prothrombin or proteins induced by vitamin\nK absence (PIVKA-II) as a marker of subclinical vitamin K deﬁciency have\nsuggested that it is the low cumulative intake of human milk in the ﬁrst week\nof life rather than an abnormally low milk concentration per se that seems to\nbe of greater relevance ( 30, 31). Thus, classic VKDB may be related, at least\nin part, to a failure to establish early breast-feeding practices.\nFor late VKDB other factors seem to be important because the deﬁciency\nsyndrome occurs when breastfeeding is well established and mothers of\naffected infants seem to have normal concentrations of vitamin K in their milk\n(31).

First, there is now a convincing body of evi-\ndence showing that without vitamin K prophylaxis, infants have a small but\nreal risk of dying from, or being permanently brain damaged by, vitamin K\ndeﬁciency in the ﬁrst 6 months of life (19, 22, 23). The other, much less certain\nevidence stems from a reported epidemiological association between vitamin\nK given intramuscularly (but not orally) and the later development of child-\nhood cancer (32). The debate, both scientiﬁc and public, which followed this\nand other publications has led to an increase in the use of multiple oral sup-\nplements instead of the traditional single intramuscular injection (usually of\n1mg phylloquinone) given at birth. Although most of the subsequent epi-\ndemiological studies have not conﬁrmed any cancer link with vitamin K pro-\nphylaxis, the issue is still not resolved ( 33, 34).\n6.4.3 Vitamin K deficiency in adults\nIn adults, primary vitamin K-deﬁcient states that manifest as bleeding are\nalmost unknown except when the absorption of the vitamin is impaired as a\nresult of an underlying pathology ( 1).\n6.5 Sources of vitamin K\n6.5.1 Dietary sources\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography can be used to accurately deter-\nmine the major dietary form of vitamin K (phylloquinone) in foods, and food\ntables are being compiled for Western diets (16, 35, 36).

Another imponder-\nable factor is the evidence that animal tissues and dairy produce may contain\nsome MK-4 as a product of tissue synthesis from phylloquinone itself ( 37).\nKnowledge of the vitamin K content of human milk has been the subject\nof methodologic controversies with a 10-fold variation in reported values of\nphylloquinone concentrations of mature human milk ( 38). Where milk sam-\npling and analytical techniques have met certain criteria for their validity, the\nphylloquinone content of mature milk has generally ranged between 1 and\n4mg/l, with average concentrations near the lower end of this range ( 28, 29,\n38). However, there is considerable intra- and intersubject variation, and levels\nare higher in colostral milk than in mature milk ( 28).

Because the lipophilic properties of menaquinones are greater\nthan those of phylloquinone, it is likely that the efﬁciency of their absorp-\ntion, in the free form, is low, as has been suggested by animal studies (18, 21).\n6.5.3 Importance of intestinal bacterial synthesis as a source of\nvitamin K\nIntestinal microﬂora synthesize large amounts of menaquinones, which are\npotentially available as a source of vitamin K (42). Quantitative measurements\nat different sites of the human intestine have demonstrated that most of these\nmenaquinones are present in the distal colon ( 42).

The widespread presence of MKs 10–13 in human livers at\nhigh concentrations (14, 15) therefore suggests that these forms, at least, orig-\ninate from intestinal synthesis ( 16).\nIt is commonly held that animals and humans obtain a signiﬁcant fraction\nof their vitamin K requirement from direct absorption of menaquinones pro-\nduced by microﬂoral synthesis ( 43), but conclusive experimental evidence\ndocumenting the site and extent of absorption is singularly lacking ( 18, 19,\n23).

It has been well established that placental transport of vitamin K to the\nhuman fetus is difﬁcult (19, 22). The limited available data suggest that hepatic\nstores of menaquinones build up gradually after birth, becoming detectable\nat around the second week of life but only reaching adult concentrations after\n1 month of age ( 14, 49). A gradual increase in liver stores of menaquinones\nmay reﬂect the gradual colonization of the gut by enteric microﬂora.\nA practical problem in assessing the functional status of vitamin K in the\nneonatal period is that there are both gestational and postnatal increases in\nthe four vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors which are unrelated to\nvitamin K status ( 50). This means that unless the deﬁciency state is quite\nsevere, it is very difﬁcult to interpret clotting factor activities as a measure of\nvitamin K sufﬁciency.

Deﬁciency signs are less common\nin infants who have received adequate vitamin K supplementation ( 52, 53) or\nwho have been formula fed ( 52).\n6.6.5 Dietary intakes in older infants, children, and adults and\ntheir adequacy\nThe only comprehensive national survey of phylloquinone intakes across all\nage groups (except infants aged 0–6 months) is that of the United States Food\nand Drug Administration Total Diet Study, which was based on the 1987–88\nNationwide Food Consumption Survey ( 40). For infants and children from\nthe age of 6 months to 16 years, average phylloquinone intakes were above\nthe current United States recommended dietary allowance (RDA) values for\ntheir respective age groups, more so for children up to 10 years than from 10\nto 16 years (Table 6.3) (40). No studies have been conducted that assess func-\ntional markers of vitamin K sufﬁciency in children.\nIntakes for adults in the Total Diet Study (Table 6.3) were also close to or\nslightly higher than the current United States RDA values of 80 mg for men\nand 65 mg for women, although intakes were slightly lower than the RDA in\nthe 25–30-years age group (54).

After this depletion phase the subjects\nentered a 16-day repletion period during which, over 4-day intervals, they\nwere sequentially repleted with 5, 15, 25, and 45 mg of phylloquinone.

The most dramatic change was in plasma levels of phylloquinone,\nwhich fell to about 15% of the values determined on day 1. The drop in\nplasma phylloquinone also suggested that the average dietary intake of these\nparticular individuals before they entered the study had been greater than the\nbaseline diet of 80 mg/day. The repletion protocol failed to bring the plasma\nphylloquinone levels of the young subjects back above the lower limit of the\nnormal range (previously established in healthy adults) and the plasma levels\nin the elderly group rose only slightly above this lower limit in the last 4 days.\nAnother indication of a reduced vitamin K status in the young group was the\nfall in urinary output of Gla (to 90% of baseline) that was not seen in the\nelderly group; this suggested that the younger subjects were more suscepti-\nble to the effects of an acute deﬁciency than were the older subjects.\nOne important dietary intervention study measured the carboxylation\nstatus of the bone vitamin K-dependent protein, osteocalcin, in response to\naltered dietary intakes of phylloquinone ( 62).

Of the etiologic factors,\nsome of which may still be unrecognized, one factor in some infants is mild\ncholestasis. The problem of overcoming a variable and, in some infants, inef-\nﬁcient absorption is the likely reason that oral prophylactic regimens, even\nwith two or three pharmacologic doses (1mg phylloquinone), have occasion-\nally failed to prevent VKDB ( 63).

Clearly then, an optimal intake would lie below an\nintake of 50mg/day. Cornelissen et al. (64) evaluated the effectiveness of giving\ninfants a daily supplement of 25 mg phylloquinone after they had received a\nsingle oral dose of 1mg at birth. This regimen resulted in median plasma levels\nat ages 4, 8, and 12 weeks of around 2.2nmol/l (1.0 mg/l) when sampled 20–28\nhours after the most recent vitamin K dose; this level corresponds to the upper\nend of the adult fasting range. In 12-week-old infants supplemented with this\nregime, the median plasma level was about four-fold higher than that in a\ncontrol group of unsupplemented infants (1.9 versus 0.5nmol/l). Also none\nof the 50 supplemented infants had detectable PIVKA-II at 12 weeks com-\npared with 15 of 131 infants (11.5%) in the control group.

Vitamin C is syn-\nthesized in the liver in some mammals and in the kidney in birds and reptiles.\nHowever, several species—including humans, non-human primates, guinea\npigs, Indian fruit bats, and Nepalese red-vented bulbuls—are unable to syn-\nthesize vitamin C. When there is insufﬁcient vitamin C in the diet, humans\nsuffer from the potentially lethal deﬁciency disease scurvy ( 1). Humans and\nprimates lack the terminal enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of ascorbic\nacid, l-gulonolactone oxidase, because the gene encoding for the enzyme has\nundergone substantial mutation so that no protein is produced ( 2).\n7.2R ole of vitamin C in human metabolic processes\n7.2.1 Background biochemistry\nVitamin C is an electron donor (reducing agent or antioxidant), and proba-\nbly all of its biochemical and molecular roles can be accounted for by this\nfunction. The potentially protective role of vitamin C as an antioxidant is\ndiscussed in the antioxidants chapter of this report (see Chapter 8).\n7.2.2 Enzymatic functions\nVitamin C acts as an electron donor for 11 enzymes ( 3, 4). Three of those\nenzymes are found in fungi but not in humans or other mammals ( 5, 6) and\nare involved in reutilization pathways for pyrimidines and the deoxyribose\nmoiety of deoxynucleosides. Of the eight remaining human enzymes, three\nparticipate in collagen hydroxylation ( 7–9) and two in carnitine biosynthesis\n(10, 11); of the three enzymes which participate in collagen hydroxylation,\none is necessary for biosynthesis of the catecholamine norepinephrine ( 12,\n13), one is necessary for amidation of peptide hormones ( 14, 15), and one is\ninvolved in tyrosine metabolism ( 4, 16).\nAscorbate interacts with enzymes having either monooxygenase or dioxy-\ngenase activity.

The dioxyge-\nnases incorporate two oxygen atoms in two different ways: the enzyme 4-\nhydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase incorporates two oxygen atoms into\none product; the other dioxygenase incorporates one oxygen atom into suc-\ncinate and one into the enzyme-speciﬁc substrate.\n7.2.3 Miscellaneous functions\nConcentrations of vitamin C appear to be high in gastric juice. Schorah et al.\n(17) found that the concentrations of vitamin C in gastric juice were several-\nfold higher (median, 249mmol/l; range, 43–909mmol/l) than those found in the\nplasma of the same normal subjects (median, 39mmol/l; range, 14–101mmol/l).\nGastric juice vitamin C may prevent the formation of N-nitroso compounds,\nwhich are potentially mutagenic (18). High intakes of vitamin C correlate with\nreduced gastric cancer risk ( 19), but a cause-and-effect relationship has not\nbeen established. Vitamin C protects low-density lipoproteins ex vivo against\noxidation and may function similarly in the blood ( 20) (see Chapter 8).\nA common feature of vitamin C deﬁciency is anaemia. The antioxidant\nproperties of vitamin C may stabilize folate in food and in plasma; increased\nexcretion of oxidized folate derivatives in humans with scurvy has been\nreported (21). Vitamin C promotes absorption of soluble non-haem iron pos-\nsibly by chelation or simply by maintaining the iron in the reduced (ferrous,\nFe\n2+) form ( 22, 23). The effect can be achieved with the amounts of vitamin\nC obtained in foods. However, the amount of dietary vitamin C required to\nincrease iron absorption ranges from 25mg upwards and depends largely on\nthe amount of inhibitors, such as phytates and polyphenols, present in the\nmeal (24).

Scurvy was described\nby the Crusaders during the sieges of numerous European cities, and was also\na result of the famine in 19th century Ireland. Three important manifestations\nof scurvy—gingival changes, pain in the extremities, and haemorrhagic man-\nifestations—precede oedema, ulcerations, and ultimately death. Skeletal and\nvascular lesions related to scurvy probably arise from a failure of osteoid\nformation. In infantile scurvy the changes are mainly at the sites of most\nactive bone growth; characteristic signs are a pseudoparalysis of the limbs\ncaused by extreme pain on movement and caused by haemorrhages under the\nperiosteum, as well as swelling and haemorrhages of the gums surrounding\n7.

In adults, one of the early principle adverse effects of the\ncollagen-related pathology may be impaired wound healing ( 26).\nVitamin C deﬁciency can be detected from early signs of clinical deﬁciency,\nsuch as the follicular hyperkeratosis, petechial haemorrhages, swollen or\nbleeding gums, and joint pain, or from the very low concentrations of ascor-\nbate in plasma, blood, or leukocytes. The Shefﬁeld studies ( 26, 27) and the\nlater studies in Iowa (28, 29) were the ﬁrst major attempts to quantify vitamin\nC requirements. The studies indicated that the amount of vitamin C required\nto prevent or cure early signs of deﬁciency is between 6.5 and 10mg/day. This\nrange represents the lowest physiological requirement. The Iowa studies ( 28,\n29) and Kallner et al. ( 30) established that at tissue saturation, whole-body\nvitamin C content is approximately 20mg/kg, or 1500mg, and that during\ndepletion vitamin C is lost at a rate of 3% of whole-body content per day.\nClinical signs of scurvy appear in men at intakes lower than 10mg/day (27)\nor when the whole-body content falls below 300mg ( 28). Such intakes are\nassociated with plasma ascorbate concentrations below 11 mmol/l or leuko-\ncyte levels less than 2nmol/10\n8 cells. However, plasma concentrations fall to\naround 11 mmol/l even when dietary vitamin C is between 10 and 20mg/day.\nAt intakes greater than 25–35mg/day, plasma concentrations start to rise\nsteeply, indicating a greater availability of vitamin C for metabolic needs. In\ngeneral, plasma ascorbate closely reﬂects the dietary intake and ranges\nbetween 20 and 80 mmol/l. During infection or physical trauma, the number\nof circulating leukocytes increases and these take up vitamin C from the\nplasma (31, 32). Therefore, both plasma and leukocyte levels may not be very\nprecise indicators of body content or status at such times.

The physiologi-\ncally efﬁcient, renal-tubular reabsorption mechanism retains vitamin C in\nthe tissues up to a whole-body content of ascorbate of about 20mg/kg\nbody weight ( 30). However, under steady-state conditions, as intake rises\nfrom around 100mg/day there is an increase in urinary output so that at\n1000mg/day almost all absorbed vitamin C is excreted ( 34, 35).\n7.4P opulations at risk for vitamin C deficiency\nThe populations at risk of vitamin C deﬁciency are those for whom the fruit\nand vegetable supply is minimal.

Persons in whom the total body vitamin C content is\nsaturated (i.e. 20mg/kg body weight) can subsist without vitamin C for\napproximately 2 months before the appearance of clinical signs, and as little\nas 6.5–10mg/day of vitamin C will prevent the appearance of scurvy. In\ngeneral, vitamin C status will reﬂect the regularity of fruit and vegetable con-\nsumption; however, socioeconomic conditions are also factors as intake is\ndetermined not just by availability of food, but by cultural preferences and cost.\nIn Europe and the United States an adequate intake of vitamin C is\nindicated by the results of various national surveys ( 36–38). In Germany and\nthe United Kingdom, the mean dietary intakes of vitamin C in adult men and\nwomen were 75 and 72mg/day ( 36), and 87 and 76mg/day ( 37), respectively.\nIn addition, a recent survey of elderly men and women in the United\nKingdom reported vitamin C intakes of 72 (SD, 61) and 68 (SD, 60)mg/day,\nrespectively (39). In the United States, in the third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey ( 38), the median consumption of vitamin C from\nfoods during the years 1988–91 was 73 and 84mg/day in men and women,\nrespectively. In all of these studies there was a wide variation in vitamin C\nintake. In the United States 25–30% of the population consumed less than 2.5\nservings of fruit and vegetables daily. Likewise, a survey of Latin American\nchildren suggested that less than 15% consumed the recommended intake of\nfruits and vegetables ( 40). It is not possible to relate servings of fruits and\nvegetables to an exact amount of vitamin C, but the WHO dietary goal of\n400g/day ( 41), aimed at providing sufﬁcient vitamin C to meet the 1970\nFAO/WHO guidelines—that is, approximately 20–30mg/day—and lower\nthe risk of chronic disease.

It is not possible to relate servings of fruits and\nvegetables to an exact amount of vitamin C, but the WHO dietary goal of\n400g/day ( 41), aimed at providing sufﬁcient vitamin C to meet the 1970\nFAO/WHO guidelines—that is, approximately 20–30mg/day—and lower\nthe risk of chronic disease. The WHO goal has been roughly translated into\nthe recommendation of ﬁve portions of fruits and vegetables per day ( 42).\nReports from India show that the available supply of vitamin C is\n43mg/capita/day, and in the different states of India it ranges from 27 to\n66mg/day. In one study, low-income children consumed as little as 8.2mg/day\nof vitamin C in contrast to a well-to-do group of children where the intake\nwas 35.4mg/day ( 43). Other studies done in developing countries found\nplasma vitamin C concentrations lower than those reported for developed\ncountries, for example, 20–27 mmol/l for apparently healthy adolescent boys\nand girls in China and 3–54 mmol/l (median, 14 mmol/l) for similarly aged\nGambian nurses (44, 45), although values obtained in a group of adults from\na rural district in northern Thailand were quite acceptable (median, 44mmol/l;\nrange, 17–118 mmol/l) ( 46). However, it is difﬁcult to assess the extent to\nwhich subclinical infections are lowering the plasma vitamin C concentrations\nseen in such countries.\nP130-144 3/12/05 17:05 Page 133",

    "text": "Claims for a positive association between vitamin C consumption and\nhealth status are frequently made, but results from intervention studies are\ninconsistent. Low plasma concentrations are reported in patients with dia-\nbetes (47) and infections ( 48) and in smokers ( 49), but the relative contribu-\ntion of diet and stress to these situations is uncertain (see Chapter 8 on\nantioxidants). Epidemiological studies indicate that diets with a high vitamin\nC content have been associated with lower cancer risk, especially for cancers\nof the oral cavity, oesophagus, stomach, colon, and lung (39, 50–52). However,\nthere appears to be no effect of consumption of vitamin C supplements on\nthe development of colorectal adenoma and stomach cancer (52–54), and data\non the effect of vitamin C supplementation on coronary heart disease and\ncataract development are conﬂicting ( 55–74). Currently there is no consistent\nevidence from population studies that heart disease, cancers, or cataract devel-\nopment are speciﬁcally associated with vitamin C status. This of course does\nnot preclude the possibility that other components in vitamin C-rich fruits\nand vegetables provide health beneﬁts, but it is not yet possible to isolate such\neffects from other factors such as lifestyle patterns of people who have a high\nvitamin C intake.\n7.5 Dietary sources of vitamin C and limitations to\nvitamin C supply\nAscorbate is found in many fruits and vegetables (75). Citrus fruits and juices\nare particularly rich sources of vitamin C but other fruits including cantaloupe\nand honeydew melons, cherries, kiwi fruits, mangoes, papaya, strawberries,\ntangelo, tomatoes, and water melon also contain variable amounts of vitamin\nC. Vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, cau-\nliﬂower, kale, mustard greens, red and green peppers, peas, and potatoes may\nbe more important sources of vitamin C than fruits, given that the vegetable\nsupply often extends for longer periods during the year than does the fruit\nsupply.\nIn many developing countries, the supply of vitamin C is often determined\nby seasonal factors (i.e. the availability of water, time, and labour for the man-\nagement of household gardens and the short harvesting season of many",

The vitamin C\ncontent of food is thus strongly inﬂuenced by season, transport to market,\nlength of time on the shelf and in storage, cooking practices, and the chlori-\nnation of the water used in cooking. Cutting or bruising of produce releases\nascorbate oxidase. Blanching techniques inactivate the oxidase enzyme and\nhelp to preserve ascorbate; lowering the pH of a food will similarly achieve\nthis, as in the preparation of sauerkraut (pickled cabbage). In contrast, heating\nand exposure to copper or iron or to mildly alkaline conditions destroys the\nvitamin, and too much water can leach it from the tissues during cooking.\nIt is important to realize that the amount of vitamin C in a food is usually\nnot the major determinant of a food’s importance for supply, but rather reg-\nularity of intake. For example, in countries where the potato is an important\nstaple food and refrigeration facilities are limited, seasonal variations in plasma\nascorbate are due to the considerable deterioration in the potato’s vitamin C\ncontent during storage; the content can decrease from 30 to 8mg/100g over\n8–9 months ( 77). Such data illustrate the important contribution the potato\ncan make to human vitamin C requirements even though the potato’s vitamin\nC concentration is low.\nAn extensive study has been made of losses of vitamin C during the pack-\naging, storage, and cooking of blended foods (i.e. maize and soya-based relief\nfoods). Data from a United States international development programme\nshow that vitamin C losses from packaging and storage in polythene bags of\nsuch relief foods are much less signiﬁcant than the 52–82% losses attributa-\nble to conventional cooking procedures ( 78).\n7.6 Evidence used to derive recommended intakes of\nvitamin C\n7.6.1 Adults\nAt saturation the whole body content of ascorbate in adult males is approx-\nimately 20mg/kg, or 1500mg.

Thus, an intake of 45mg/day will ensure that measurable\namounts of ascorbate will be present in the plasma of most people and will\nbe available to supply tissue requirements for metabolism or repair at sites of\ndepletion or damage. A whole-body content of around 900mg of vitamin C\nwould provide at least one month’s safety interval, even for a zero intake,\nbefore the body content falls to 300mg ( 82).\nThe Shefﬁeld ( 27) and Iowa studies ( 28) referred to earlier indicated that\nthe minimum amount of vitamin C needed to cure scurvy in men is less than\n10mg/day. This level however, is not sufﬁcient to provide measurable\namounts of ascorbate in plasma and leukocyte cells, which will remain low.\nAs indicated above, no studies have been done on women and minimum\nrequirements to protect non-pregnant and non-lactating women against\nscurvy might be slightly lower than those for men. Although 10mg/day will\nprotect against scurvy, this amount provides no safety margin against further\nlosses of ascorbate. The mean requirement is therefore calculated by interpo-\nlation between 10 and 45mg/day, at an intake of 25–30mg/day.\n7.6.2 Pregnant and lactating women\nDuring pregnancy there is a moderate increased need for vitamin C, particu-\nlarly during the last trimester. Eight mg/day of vitamin C is reported to\nbe sufﬁcient to prevent scorbutic signs in infants aged 4–17 months ( 83).\nTherefore, an extra 10mg/day throughout pregnancy should enable\nreserves to accumulate to meet the extra needs of the growing fetus in the last\ntrimester.\nDuring lactation, however, 20mg/day of vitamin C is secreted in milk.\nFor an assumed absorption efﬁciency of 85%, maternal needs will require\nan extra 25mg per day. It is therefore recommended that the RNI should\nbe set at 70mg/day to fulﬁl the needs of both the mother and infant during\nlactation.\n7.6.",

VITAMIN C\n7.8 Toxicity\nThe potential toxicity of excessive doses of supplemental vitamin C relates to\nintraintestinal events and to the effects of metabolites in the urinary system.\nIntakes of 2–3g/day of vitamin C produce unpleasant diarrhoea from the\nosmotic effects of the unabsorbed vitamin in the intestinal lumen in most\npeople (88). Gastrointestinal disturbances can occur after ingestion of as little\nas 1g because approximately half of this amount would not be absorbed at\nthis dose (35).\nOxalate is an end-product of ascorbate catabolism and plays an important\nrole in kidney stone formation. Excessive daily amounts of vitamin C produce\nhyperoxaluria. In four volunteers who received vitamin C in doses ranging\nfrom 5 to 10g/day, mean urinary oxalate excretion approximately doubled\nfrom 50 to 87mg/day (range, 60–126mg/day) ( 89). However, the risk of\noxalate stone formation may become signiﬁcant at high intakes of vitamin C\n(>1g) (90), particularly in subjects with high amounts of urinary calcium (89).\nVitamin C may precipitate haemolysis in some people, including those with\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deﬁciency ( 91), paroxysmal nocturnal\nhaemaglobinuria ( 92), or other conditions where increased risk of red cell\nhaemolysis may occur or where protection against the removal of the prod-\nucts of iron metabolism may be impaired, as in people with the haptoglobin\nHp2-2 phenotype (93). Of these, only the haptoglobin Hp2-2 condition was\nassociated with abnormal vitamin C metabolism (lower plasma ascorbate than\nexpected) and only in cases where intake of vitamin C was provided mainly\nfrom dietary sources.\nOn the basis of the above, the Consultation agreed that 1g of vitamin C\nappears to be the advisable upper limit of dietary intake per day.\n7.9R ecommendations for future research\nResearch is needed to gain a better understanding of the following:\n• functions of endogenous gastric ascorbate and its effect on iron\nabsorption;\n• functional measurements of vitamin C status which reﬂect the",

    "text": "8. Dietary antioxidants\n8.1 Nutrients with an antioxidant role\nThe potential beneﬁcial effects of antioxidants in protecting against disease\nhave been used as an argument for recommending increasing intakes of several\nnutrients above those derived by conventional methods. If it is possible to\nquantify such claims, antioxidant properties should be considered in decisions\nconcerning the daily requirements of these nutrients. This section examines\nmetabolic aspects of the most important dietary antioxidants—vitamins C and\nE, the carotenoids, and several minerals—and tries to deﬁne the populations\nwhich may be at risk of inadequacy to determine whether antioxidant prop-\nerties per se should be, and can be, considered in setting a requirement. In addi-\ntion, pro-oxidant metabolism and the importance of iron are also considered.\nMembers of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research\nCouncil in the United States recently deﬁned a dietary antioxidant as a sub-\nstance in foods which signiﬁcantly decreases the adverse effects of reactive\noxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, or both on normal physiological\nfunction in humans ( 1). It is recognized that this deﬁnition is somewhat\nnarrow because maintenance of membrane stability is also a feature of anti-\noxidant function ( 2) and an important antioxidant function of both vitamin\nA (3) and zinc ( 4). However, it was decided to restrict consideration of anti-\noxidant function in this document to nutrients which were likely to interact\nmore directly with reactive species.\n8.2 The need for biological antioxidants\nIt is now well established that free radicals, especially superoxide (O2\n.-), nitric\noxide (NO.), and other reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2),\nare continuously produced in vivo (5–7). Superoxide in particular is produced\nby leakage from the electron transport chains within the mitochondria and\nmicrosomal P450 systems ( 8) or formed more deliberately, for example, by\nactivated phagocytes as part of the primary immune defence in response to\nforeign substances or to combat infection by microorganisms (9). Nitric oxide\nis produced from l-arginine by nitric oxide synthases, and these enzymes are\nP145-163 3/12/05 17:06 Page 145",

Nitric oxide is a free radical but is believed to be essentially\na beneﬁcial metabolite and indeed it may react with lipid peroxides and func-\ntion as an antioxidant ( 10). Nitric oxide also serves as a mediator whereby\nmacrophages express cytotoxic activity against microorganisms and neoplas-\ntic cells (11). If nitric oxide is at a sufﬁciently high concentration, it can react\nrapidly with superoxide in the absence of a catalyst to form peroxynitrite.\nPeroxynitrite is a potentially damaging nitrogen species which can react\nthrough several different mechanisms, including the formation of an inter-\nmediate through a reaction with a hydroxyl radical ( 12).\nTo cope with potentially damaging reactive oxidant species (ROS), aerobic\ntissues contain endogenously produced antioxidant enzymes such as super-\noxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase as well as\nseveral exogenously acquired radical-scavenging substances such as vitamins\nE and C and the carotenoids ( 13). Under normal conditions, the high con-\ncentrations of SOD maintain superoxide concentrations at a level too low to\nallow the formation of peroxynitrite. It is also important to mention the antiox-\nidant, reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is ubiquitous in aerobic tissues, and\nalthough it is not a nutrient, it is synthesized from sulfhydryl-containing amino\nacids and is highly important in intermediary antioxidant metabolism ( 14).\nIntegrated antioxidant defences protect tissues and are presumably in equi-\nlibrium with continuously generated ROS to maintain tissues metabolically\nintact most of the time. Disturbances to the system occur when production\nof ROS is rapidly increased, for example, by excessive exercise, high exposure\nto xenobiotic compounds (such as an anaesthetic, pollutants, or unusual food),\ninfection, or trauma. Superoxide production is increased by activation of\nNADPH oxidases in inﬂammatory cells or after the production of xanthine\noxidase, which follows ischaemia.

The degree of damage resulting from the\ntemporary imbalance depends on the ability of the antioxidant systems to\nrespond to the oxidant or pro-oxidant load. Fruits and vegetables are good\nsources of many antioxidants, and it is reported that diets rich in these foods\nare associated with a lower risk of the chronic diseases of cancer (15) and heart\ndisease (16). Hence, it is believed that a healthful diet maintains the exoge-\nnous antioxidants at or near optimal levels thus reducing the risk of tissue\ndamage. The most prominent representatives of dietary antioxidants are\nvitamin C, tocopherols, carotenoids, and ﬂavonoids ( 17–19). Requirements\nfor ﬂavonoids are not being considered at this time, as work on this subject\nis still very much in its infancy. In contrast, several intervention studies have\nbeen carried out to determine whether supplements of the other nutrients can\nprovide additional beneﬁts against diseases such as those mentioned above.\nP145-163 3/12/05 17:06 Page 146",

    "text": "The components of biological tissues are an ideal mixture of substrates\nfor oxidation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), transition metals, and\noxygen are present in abundance but are prevented from reaction by cellular\norganization and structure. PUFAs are present in membranes but are always\nfound with vitamin E. Transition metals, particularly iron, are bound to both\ntransport and storage proteins; abundant binding sites on such proteins\nprevent overloading the protein molecule with metal ions. Tissue structures,\nhowever, break down during inﬂammation and disease, and free iron and\nother transition metals have been detected during these periods ( 20, 21).\nPotentially damaging metabolites can arise from interactions between tran-\nsition metals and the ROS described above. In particular, the highly reactive\nhydroxyl radical can be formed by the Fenton (reaction 1) and Haber-Weiss\nreactions (reaction 2; with an iron-salt catalyst) ( 22). Pathologic conditions\ngreatly increase the concentrations of both superoxide and nitric oxide, and\nthe formation of peroxynitrite has been demonstrated in macrophages, neu-\ntrophils, and cultured endothelium (reaction 3) ( 12, 23).\nDuring inﬂammation or other forms of stress and disease, the body adopts\nnew measures to counter potential pro-oxidant damage.

Similarly, the oxidized forms of vitamin C, the ascorbyl free radical\nand dehydroascorbate, may be recycled back to ascorbate by GSH or the\nenzyme dehydroascorbate reductase (13). The ability to recycle these dietary\nantioxidants may be an indication of their physiological essentiality to func-\ntion as antioxidants.\nThe biological antioxidant properties of the carotenoids depend very much\non oxygen tension and concentration ( 33, 34). At low oxygen tension b-\ncarotene acts as a chain-breaking antioxidant whereas at high oxygen tension\nit readily autoxidizes and exhibits pro-oxidant behaviour ( 33). Palozza ( 34)\nhas reviewed much of the evidence and has suggested that b-carotene has\nantioxidant activity between 2 and 20mmHg of oxygen tension, but at the\noxygen tension in air or above ( >150mmHg) it is much less effective as an\nantioxidant and can show pro-oxidant activity as the oxygen tension increases.\nPalozza (34) also suggested that autoxidation reactions of b-carotene may be\ncontrolled by the presence of other antioxidants (e.g. vitamins E and C) or\nother carotenoids. There is some evidence that intake of large quantities of\nfat-soluble nutrients such as b-carotene and other carotenoids may cause them\nto compete with each other during absorption and lower plasma concentra-\ntions of other nutrients derived from the diet. However, a lack of other antiox-\nidants is unlikely to explain the increased incidence of lung cancer that was\nobserved in a a-tocopherol/b-carotene intervention study, because there was\nno difference in cancer incidence between the group which received both b-\ncarotene and a-tocopherol and the groups which received one treatment only\n(35).\nThe free radical formed from a dietary antioxidant is potentially a pro-\noxidant as is any other free radical.

To func-\ntion effectively, this enzyme also needs a supply of hydrogen, which it obtains\nfrom reduced glutathione (GSH). Cellular concentrations of GSH are main-\ntained by the riboﬂavin-dependent enzyme glutathione reductase.\nFour forms of selenium-dependent GPx have been described, each with dif-\nferent activities in different parts of the cell ( 38). In addition, a selenium-\ndependent enzyme, thioredoxin reductase, was recently characterized in\nhuman erythrocytes. Thioredoxin reductase may be particularly important to\nthe thyroid gland because it can cope with higher concentrations of peroxide\nand hydroperoxides generated in the course of thyroid hormone synthesis\nbetter than can GPx ( 39). It has been suggested that in combination with\niodine deﬁciency, the inability to remove high concentrations of hydrogen\nperoxide may cause atrophy in the thyroid gland, resulting in myxedematous\ncretinism (39).\nSOD and GPx are widely distributed in aerobic tissues and, if no catalytic\nmetal ions are available, endogenously produced superoxide and hydrogen\nperoxide at physiological concentrations probably have limited, if any, dam-\naging effects (36).

Both are powerful antioxidants, and the most impor-\ntant difference between these two compounds stems from their different sol-\nubility in biological ﬂuids. Vitamin C is water-soluble and is therefore\nespecially found in the aqueous fractions of the cell and in body ﬂuids whereas\nvitamin E is highly lipophilic and is found in membranes and lipoproteins.\n8.5.1 Vitamin E\nVitamin E falls into the class of conventional antioxidants which generally\nconsist of phenols or aromatic amines (see Chapter 5). In the case of the four\ntocopherols that, together with the four tocotrienols constitute vitamin E, the\ninitial step involves a very rapid transfer of phenolic hydrogen to the recipi-\nent free radical with the formation of a phenoxyl radical from vitamin E. The\nphenoxyl radical is resonance stabilized and is relatively unreactive towards\nlipid or oxygen. It does not therefore continue the chain ( 33, 46). However,\nthe phenoxyl radical is no longer an antioxidant and to maintain the antioxi-\ndant properties of membranes, it must be recycled or repaired (i.e. reconverted\nto vitamin E) because the amount of vitamin E present in membranes can\nbe several thousand-fold less than the amount of potentially oxidizable sub-\nstrate (47).

Within biological membranes, vitamin E is believed to intercalate with\nphospholipids and provide protection to PUFAs. PUFAs are particularly\nsusceptible to free radical-mediated oxidation because of their methylene-\ninterrupted double-bond structure. The amount of PUFAs in the membrane\nfar exceeds the amount of vitamin E, and the tocopherol–PUFA ratios are\nhighest in tissues where oxygen exposure is greatest and not necessarily where\nthe PUFA content is highest ( 47).\nOxidation of PUFAs leads to disturbances in membrane structure and\nfunction and is damaging to cell function. Vitamin E is highly efﬁcient at pre-\nventing the autoxidation of lipid and it appears that its primary, and possibly\nonly, role in biological tissues is to perform this function ( 46). Autoxidation\nof lipid is initiated by a free radical abstracting hydrogen from PUFA to form\na lipid radical (reaction 6), which is followed by a rearrangement of the\ndouble-bond structure to form a conjugated diene. In vitro the presence of\nminute amounts of peroxides and transition metals will stimulate the forma-\ntion of the initial radical. Oxygen adds to the lipid radical to form a lipid per-\noxide (reaction 7), which then reacts with another lipid molecule to form a\nhydroperoxide and a new lipid radical (reaction 8). This process is shown in\ngeneral terms below for the autoxidation of any organic molecule (RH),\nwhere the initial abstraction is caused by a hydroxyl radical (OH\n·).\nAutoxidation or lipid peroxidation is represented by reactions 6 and 7.

For example, the consequences of scurvy, such as\nthe breakdown of connective tissue ﬁbres ( 51) and muscular weakness ( 52),\nare both linked to hydroxylation reactions in which ascorbate maintains\nloosely bound iron in the ferrous form to prevent its oxidation to the ferric\nform, which makes the hydroxylase enzymes inactive (53). Ascorbate exhibits\nsimilar redox functions in catecholamine biosynthesis (53) and in microsomal\ncytochrome P450 enzyme activity, although the latter may only be important\nin young animals (54). In the eye, vitamin C concentrations may be 50 times\nhigher than in the plasma and may protect against the oxidative damage of\nlight (55). Vitamin C is also present in the gonads, where it may play a criti-\ncal role in sperm maturation ( 56). Spermatogenesis involves many more cell\ndivisions than does oogenesis, resulting in an increased risk of mutation.\nFraga et al.

Indeed, several authors\nsuggest that the hydroxy-carotenoids are better radical-trapping antioxidants\nthan is b-carotene ( 81, 82). It has also been suggested that because the\ncarotenoid molecule is long enough to span the bilayer lipid membrane ( 83),\nthe presence of oxy functional groups on the ring structures may facilitate\nsimilar reactivation of the carotenoid radical in a manner similar to that of the\nphenoxyl radical of vitamin E ( 33).\nThere is some evidence for an antioxidant role for b-carotene in immune\ncells. Bendich (84) suggested that b-carotene protects phagocytes from autox-\nidative damage; enhances T and B lymphocyte proliferative responses; stim-\nulates effector T cell function; and enhances macrophage, cytotoxic T cell, and\nnatural killer cell tumoricidal capacity. However, there are data which con-\nﬂict with the evidence of the protective effects of b-carotene on the immune\nsystem (85, 86) and other data which have found no effect ( 87). An explana-\ntion for the discrepancy may reside in the type of subjects chosen: defences\n8. DIETARY ANTIOXIDANTS\nP145-163 3/12/05 17:06 Page 155",

Thus in a metabolically active tissue cell in a\nhealthy subject with an adequate dietary intake, damage to tissue will be\nminimal and most of the damage, if it does occur, will be repaired ( 36). Fruit\nand vegetables are an important dietary source of antioxidant nutrients, and\nit is now well established that individuals consuming generous amounts of\nthese foods have a lower risk of chronic disease than those whose intake is\nsmall ( 15, 16, 89). These observations suggest that the antioxidant nutrient\nrequirements of the general population can be met by a generous consump-\ntion of fruit and vegetables and the slogan “ﬁve portions a day” has been pro-\nmoted to publicize this idea ( 90).\nOccasionally, free radical damage may occur which is not repaired, and the\nrisk of this happening may increase in the presence of infection or physical\ntrauma. Such effects may exacerbate an established infection or may initiate\nirreversible changes leading to a state of chronic disease (e.g. a neoplasm or\natherosclerotic lesions). Can such effects be minimized by a generous intake\nof dietary antioxidants in the form of fruit and vegetables or are supplements\nneeded?\nIt is generally recognized that certain groups of people have an increased\nrisk of free radical-initiated damage. Premature infants, for example, are at\nincreased risk of oxidative damage because they are born with immature\nantioxidant status ( 91–93) and this may be inadequate for coping with high\nlevels of oxygen and light radiation. People who smoke are exposed to free\nradicals inhaled in the tobacco smoke and have an increased risk of many dis-\neases. People abusing alcohol need to develop increased metabolic capacity to\nhandle the extra alcohol load. Similar risks may be faced by people working\nin environments where there are elevated levels of volatile solvents (e.g. petrol\nand cleaning ﬂuids in distilleries and chemical plants).

Human metabolism can adapt to a wide range of xenobiotic sub-\nstances, but metabolic activity may be raised as a result, leading to the\nconsequent production of more ROS, which are potentially toxic to cell\nmetabolism.\nOf the above groups, smokers are the most widely accessible and this has\nmade them a target for several large antioxidant-nutrient intervention studies.\nP145-163 3/12/05 17:06 Page 156",

    "text": "In addition, smokers often display low plasma concentrations of carotenoids\nand vitamin C. However, no obvious beneﬁts to the health of smokers have\nemerged from these studies and, in fact, b-carotene supplements were associ-\nated with an increased risk of lung cancer in two separate studies ( 35, 94) and\nwith more fatal cardiac events in one of them ( 95). There was no effect on\nsubsequent disease recurrences among other risk groups—identiﬁed by their\nalready having had some non-malignant form of cancer, such as non-\nmelanomatous skin cancer ( 77) or a colorectal adenoma ( 96)—after several\nyears of elevated intakes of antioxidant nutrients. The use of b-carotene (77)\nor vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C ( 96) showed no bene-\nﬁts. Thus, the results of these clinical trials do not support the use of supple-\nmentation with antioxidant micronutrients as a means of reducing cancer or\neven cardiovascular rates, although in the general population toxicity from\nsuch supplements is very unlikely.\nSome intervention trials, however, have been more successful in demon-\nstrating a health beneﬁt. Stich and colleagues ( 97, 98) gave large quantities of\nb-carotene and sometimes vitamin A to chewers of betel quids in Kerala,\nIndia, and to Canadian Inuits with pre-malignant lesions of the oral tract and\nwitnessed reductions in leukoplakia and micronuclei from the buccal mucosa.\nBlot et al. (99) reported a 13% reduction in gastric cancer mortality in people\nliving in Linxian Province, People’s Republic of China, after taking a cocktail\nof b-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. These studies are difﬁcult to interpret\nbecause the subjects may have been marginally malnourished at the start and\nthe supplements may have merely restored nutritional adequacy. However,\ncorrecting malnutrition is unlikely to be the explanation for the positive\nresults of a selenium supplementation study conducted in the United States\nin patients with a history of basal or squamous cell cancers of the skin ( 43).\nInterestingly, the intervention with 200 mg/day of selenium for an average of\n4.5 years had no effect on the recurrence of the skin ne",

The mean age of this group was 63 years and obviously they were\nnot a normal adult population, but results of further studies are awaited with\nkeen interest. In addition, results of the Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study\nhave provided some support for a beneﬁcial effect of vitamin E in individu-\nals who have had a myocardial infarction ( 100). Recruits to the study were\nrandomly assigned to receive vitamin E (800 or 400mg/day) or a placebo.\nInitial results of the trial suggested a signiﬁcant reduction in non-fatal\nmyocardial infarctions but a non-signiﬁcant excess of cardiovascular deaths\n8.

The trial ofﬁcially ended in 1996, but mortality has continued to be\nmonitored and the authors now report signiﬁcantly fewer deaths in those who\nreceived vitamin E for the full trial ( 101) (see Chapter 5 on vitamin E).\nHowever, very recently results from the Medical Research Council/British\nHeart Foundation intervention study in 20 536 patients with heart disease\nwere reported (102). Patients received vitamin E (600 mg), vitamin C (250 mg)\nand b-carotene (20 mg) or placebo daily for ﬁve years. There were no signif-\nicant reductions in all cause mortality, or deaths due to vascular or non-vas-\ncular causes. Thus these antioxidant supplements provided no measurable\nhealth beneﬁts for these patients.\nIn conclusion, some studies have shown that health beneﬁts can be\nobtained by some people with an increased risk of disease from supplements\nof antioxidant nutrients. The amounts of supplements used, however, have\nbeen large and the effect possibly has been pharmacologic. Further work is\nneeded to show whether more modest increases in nutrient intakes in healthy\nadult populations will delay or prevent the onset of chronic disease. There-\nfore, the available evidence regarding health beneﬁts to be achieved by\nincreasing intakes of antioxidant nutrients does not assist in setting nutrient\nrequirements.\n8.7 Recommendations for future research\nIf nutrient intakes are ever to be recommended on the basis of antioxidant\nproperties then more research is needed to gain a better understanding of:\n• The optimal plasma or tissue concentrations of nutrients to fully support\ninteractions between antioxidant micronutrients like vitamins E and C, or\nvitamin E and Se to counter oxidant stress in the tissues.\n• The mechanisms whereby micronutrients like vitamins A and C, and min-\nerals iron and zinc are reduced at the time of oxidant stress and the phys-\niological purposes of the changes.\nThe minimal concentrations of antioxidant nutrients in humans to prevent\nconversion of benign viruses to their more virulent forms as demonstrated by\nBeck and colleagues in mice (103).\nReferences\n1.

Exces-\nsive reﬁning and polishing of cereals removes considerable proportions of B\nvitamins contained in these cereals. Clinical manifestations of deﬁciency of\nsome B vitamins—such as beriberi (cardiac and dry), peripheral neuropathies,\npellagra, and oral and genital lesions (related to riboﬂavin deﬁciency)—were\nonce major public health problems in some parts of the world. These\nmanifestations have now declined, the decline being brought about not\nthrough programmes which distribute synthetic vitamins but through\nchanges in the patterns of food availability and consequent changes in dietary\npractices.\nAlthough many clinical manifestations of B-vitamin deﬁciencies have\ndecreased, there is evidence of widespread subclinical deﬁciency of these vita-\nmins (especially of riboﬂavin and pyridoxine). These subclinical deﬁciencies,\nalthough less dramatic in their manifestations, exert deleterious metabolic\neffects. Despite the progress in reduction of large-scale deﬁciency in the\nworld, there are periodic reports of outbreaks of B-complex deﬁciencies\nwhich are linked to deﬁcits of B vitamins in populations under various dis-\ntress conditions.\nRefugee and displaced population groups (20 million people by current\nUnited Nations estimates) are at risk for B-complex deﬁciency because most\ncereal foods used under emergency situations are not fortiﬁed with micronu-\ntrients (1). Recent reports have implicated the low B-complex content of diets\nas a factor in the outbreak of peripheral neuropathy and visual loss observed\nin the adult population of Cuba ( 2–4).

It also occurs in adults with high carbohydrate\nintakes (mainly from milled rice) and with intakes of anti-thiamine factors,\nsuch as the bacterial thiaminases that are in certain ingested raw ﬁsh ( 7).\nBeriberi is still endemic in Asia. In relatively industrialized nations, the neu-\nrologic manifestations of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome are frequently asso-\nciated with chronic alcoholism in conjunction with limited food consumption\n(9). Some cases of thiamine deﬁciency have been observed with patients who\nare hypermetabolic, are on parenteral nutrition, are undergoing chronic renal\ndialysis, or have undergone a gastrectomy.

Speciﬁcally\nthe Mg\n2+-coordinated TPP participates in the formation of a-ketols (e.g.\namong hexose and pentose phosphates) as catalysed by transketolase and in\nthe oxidation of a-keto acids (e.g. pyruvate, a-ketoglutarate, and branched-\nchain a-keto acids) by dehydrogenase complexes (10, 11). Hence, when there\nis insufﬁcient thiamine, the overall decrease in carbohydrate metabolism and\nits interconnection with amino acid metabolism (via a-keto acids) has severe\nconsequences, such as a decrease in the formation of acetylcholine for neural\nfunction.\n9.2.2 Biochemical indicators\nIndicators used to estimate thiamine requirements are urinary excretion,",

Although overlap\nwith baseline values for urinary thiamine was found with oral doses below\n1mg, a correlation of 0.86 between oral and excreted amounts was found by\nBayliss et al . (12). The erythrocyte transketolase assay, in which an activity\ncoefﬁcient based on a TPP stimulation of the basal level is given, continues\nto be a main functional indicator ( 9), but some problems have been encoun-\ntered. Gans and Harper (13) found a wide range of TPP effects when thiamine\nintakes were adequate (i.e. above 1.5mg/day over a 3-day period). In some\ncases, the activity coefﬁcient may appear normal after prolonged deﬁciency\n(14). This measure seemed poorly correlated with dietary intakes estimated\nfor a group of English adolescents ( 15). Certainly, there are both interindi-\nvidual and genetic factors affecting the transketolase ( 16). Baines and Davies\n(17) suggested that it is useful to determine erythrocyte TPP directly because\nthe coenzyme is less susceptible to factors that inﬂuence enzyme activity;\nthere are also methods for determining thiamine and its phosphate esters in\nwhole blood (18).\n9.2.3 Factors affecting requirements\nBecause thiamine facilitates energy utilization, its requirements have tradi-\ntionally been expressed on the basis of energy intake, which can vary depend-\ning on activity levels.

( 25) reported thiamine intakes of 1.0 and 1.2mg/day as\nminimal for women and men, respectively. Hoorn et al. ( 26) reported that\n23% of 153 patients aged 65–93 years were deemed deﬁcient based on a trans-\nketolase activation coefﬁcient greater than 1.27, which was normalized after\nthiamine administration.

With an intake of 0.4mg thiamine/4184kJ, this amounts to a total of\n22mg thiamine needed during pregnancy, or 0.12mg/day when the additional\nthiamine need for the second and third trimesters (180 days) is included.\nTaking into account the increased need for thiamine because of an increased\ngrowth in maternal and fetal compartments and a small increase in\nenergy utilization, an overall additional requirement of 0.3mg/day is\nconsidered adequate (6).\nIt is estimated that lactating women transfer 0.2mg thiamine to their infants\nthrough their milk each day. Therefore, an additional 0.1mg is estimated as\nthe need for the increased energy cost of about 2092kJ/day associated with\nlactation (6).\n9.2.5 Recommended nutrient intakes for thiamine\nThe recommendations for thiamine are given in Table 9.2.\nTABLE 9.2\nRecommended nutrient intakes for thiamine,\nby group\nRecommended nutrient intake\nGroup (mg/day)\nInfants and children\n0–6 months 0.2\n7–12 months 0.3\n1–3 years 0.5\n4–6 years 0.6\n7–9 years 0.9\nAdoles",

As riboﬂavin deﬁciency almost\ninvariably occurs in combination with a deﬁciency of other B-complex vita-\nmins, some of the symptoms (e.g. glossitis and dermatitis) may result from\nother complicating deﬁciencies. The major cause of hyporiboﬂavinosis is\ninadequate dietary intake as a result of limited food supply, which is some-\ntimes exacerbated by poor food storage or processing. Children in develop-\ning countries will commonly demonstrate clinical signs of riboﬂavin\ndeﬁciency during periods of the year when gastrointestinal infections are\nprevalent. Decreased assimilation of riboﬂavin also results from abnormal\ndigestion, such as that which occurs with lactose intolerance. This condition\nis highest in African and Asian populations and can lead to a decreased intake\nof milk, as well as an abnormal absorption of the vitamin. Absorption of\nriboﬂavin is also affected in some other conditions, for example, tropical\nsprue, celiac disease, malignancy and resection of the small bowel, and\ndecreased gastrointestinal passage time. In relatively rare cases, the cause of\ndeﬁciency is inborn errors in which the genetic defect is in the formation of\na ﬂavoprotein (e.g. acyl-coenzyme A [coA] dehydrogenases).

However, riboﬂavin supplementation did not lead to an increase\nin work performance when such subjects were not clinically deﬁcient (42–45).\nBioavailability of riboﬂavin in foods, mostly as digestible ﬂavocoenzymes, is\nexcellent at nearly 95% (6), but absorption of the free vitamin is limited to about\n27mg per single meal or dose in an adult (46). No more than about 7% of food\nﬂavin is found as 8-a-FAD covalently attached to certain ﬂavoprotein enzymes.\nAlthough some portions of the 8- a-(amino acid)-riboﬂavins are released by\nproteolysis of these ﬂavoproteins, they do not have vitamin activity (47).\nA lower fat–carbohydrate ratio may decrease the riboﬂavin requirements\nof the elderly ( 48).

All three must be phos-\nphorylated and the 5¢-phosphates of the ﬁrst two vitamers are oxidized to the\nfunctional PLP , which serves as a carbonyl-reactive coenzyme to a number of\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids. Such enzymes include\naminotransferases, decarboxylases, and dehydratases; d-aminolevulinate syn-\nthase in haem biosynthesis; and phosphorylase in glycogen breakdown and\nsphingoid base biosynthesis ( 10, 11).\n9.5.2 Biochemical indicators\nIndicators used to estimate vitamin B 6 requirements are PLP , urinary excre-\ntion, erythrocyte aminotransferases activity coefﬁcients, tryptophan catabo-\nlites, erythrocyte and whole blood PLP , and plasma homocysteine. PLP is the\nmajor form of vitamin B\n6 in all tissues and the plasma PLP concentration\nreﬂects liver PLP . Plasma PLP changes fairly slowly in response to vitamin\nintake. The excretion rate of vitamin B\n6 and particularly its catabolite,\n4-pyridoxate, reﬂects intake. Erythrocyte aminotransferases for aspartate and\nalanine reﬂect PLP levels and show large variations in activity coefﬁcients.\nThe urinary excretion of xanthurenate, a tryptophan catabolite, is typically\nused after a tryptophan load test.\nVitamin B\n6 status is most appropriately evaluated by using a combination\nof the above indicators, including those considered as direct indicators (e.g.\nvitamer concentration in cells or ﬂuids) and those considered to be indirect\nor functional indicators (e.g. erythrocyte aminotransferase saturation by PLP\nor tryptophan metabolites) ( 9).

Younger infants (0–6 months)\nare considered to derive adequate intake from milk alone; recommendations\nfor older infants (7–12 months) are adjusted by metabolic scaling such that\na factor—weight of 7–12 month-old infant/weight of 0–6 month-old\ninfant)\n0.75—is multiplied by the recommendation for the younger infant ( 6).\nRecommendations have been given to use the higher (7–12 months) level of\nB-vitamin requirements for all infants in the ﬁrst year of life.\nAdequate intake for child or adult adequate intake young infant\nweight adult or child weight infant\n= ( )\n¥( )\n07 5.\nTABLE 9.7\nRecommended nutrient intakes for biotin, by group\nRecommended nutrient intake\nGroup ( mg/day)\nInfants and children\n0–6 months 5\n7–12 months 6\n1–3 years 8\n4–6 years 12\n7–9 years 20\nAdolescents\n10–18 years 25\nAdults\nFemales, 19+ years 30\nMales, 19+ years 30\nPregnant women 30\nLactating women 35\nP164-193 3/12/05 17:06 Page 184",

    "text": "For most of the B vitamins, there is little or no direct information that can\nbe used to estimate the amounts required by children and adolescents. Hence,\nan extrapolation from the adult level is used where a factor—(weight of\nchild/weight of adult)\n0.75 ¥ (1 + growth factor)—is multiplied by the adult\nrecommendation (6).\nFor all but one of the B-complex vitamins covered here, data are not suf-\nﬁcient to justify altering recommendations for the elderly. Only vitamin B 6\nhas altered recommendations for the elderly. However, for pregnancy and lac-\ntation, increased maternal needs related to increases in energy and replace-\nment of secretion losses are considered.\n9.8.2 Dietary sources of B-complex vitamins\nA listing of some food sources that provide good and moderate amounts of\nthe vitamins considered in this chapter is given in Table 9.8.\n9.9 Recommendations for future research\nIn view of the issues raised in this chapter on B-complex vitamins, the\nfollowing recommendations are given:\n• Actual requirements of B-complex vitamins are least certain for children,\nadolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly, and as such,\ndeserve further study.\n• Studies need to include graded levels of the vitamin above and below\ncurrent recommendations and should consider or establish clearly deﬁned\ncut-off values for clinical adequacy and inadequacy and be conducted for\nperiods of time sufﬁcient for ascertaining equilibrium dynamics.\n9.

Selenium\n10.1 Role of selenium in human metabolic processes\nOur understanding of the signiﬁcance of selenium in the nutrition of human\nsubjects has grown rapidly during the past 20 years (1, 2). Demonstrations of\nits essentiality to rats and farm animals were followed by appreciation that\nthe development of selenium-responsive diseases often reﬂected the distribu-\ntion of geochemical variables which restricted the entry of the element from\nsoils into food chains. Such ﬁndings were the stimulus to in-depth investiga-\ntions of the regional relevance of selenium in human nutrition ( 3). These\nstudies have now yielded an increased understanding of the complex meta-\nbolic role of this trace nutrient. Selenium has been implicated in the protec-\ntion of body tissues against oxidative stress, maintenance of defences against\ninfection, and modulation of growth and development.\nThe selenium content of normal adult humans can vary widely. Values from\n3mg in New Zealanders to 14mg in some Americans reﬂect the profound\ninﬂuence of the natural environment on the selenium contents of soils, crops,\nand human tissues. Approximately 30% of tissue selenium is contained in the\nliver, 15% in kidney, 30% in muscle, and 10% in blood plasma. Much of tissue\nselenium is found in proteins as selenoanalogues of sulfur amino acids; other\nmetabolically active forms include selenotrisulphides and other acid-labile\nselenium compounds. At least 15 selenoproteins have now been characterized.\nExamples are given in Table 10.1.\nFunctionally, there appear to be at least two distinct families of selenium-\ncontaining enzymes. The ﬁrst includes the glutathione peroxidases ( 4) and\nthioredoxin reductase ( 5), which are involved in controlling tissue concen-\ntrations of highly reactive oxygen-containing metabolites. These meta-\nbolites are essential at low concentrations for maintaining cell-mediated\nimmunity against infections but highly toxic if produced in excess. The role\nof selenium in the cytosolic enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), was\nﬁrst illustrated in 1973.

At least four forms\nof GSHPx exist; they differ both in their tissue distribution and in their sen-\nsitivity to selenium depletion ( 4). The GSHPx enzymes of liver and blood\nplasma fall in activity rapidly at early stages of selenium deﬁciency. In con-\ntrast, a form of GSHPx associated speciﬁcally with phospholipid-rich tissue\nmembranes is preserved against selenium deﬁciency and is believed to have\nbroader metabolic roles (e.g. in prostaglandin synthesis) ( 6). In concert with\nvitamin E, selenium is also involved in the protection of cell membranes\nagainst oxidative damage. (See also Chapter 8 on antioxidants.)\nThe selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase is involved in disposal of the\nproducts of oxidative metabolism ( 5). It contains two selenocysteine groups\nper molecule and is a major component of a redox system with a multiplicity\nof functions, among which is the capacity to degrade locally excessive and\npotentially toxic concentrations of peroxide and hydroperoxides likely to\ninduce cell death and tissue atrophy ( 6).\nAnother group of selenoproteins are the iodothyronine deiodinases essen-\ntial for the conversion of thyrocin or tetraiodothyronine (T\n4) to its physio-\nlogically active form tri-iodothyronine (T3) (7).

The inﬂuence of a loss of selenium-dependent iodothyronine deio-\ndinase differs in its severity depending on whether a target tissue needs a pre-\nformed supply of T\n3 (e.g. via plasma) or whether, as with the brain, pituitary\ngland, and placenta, it can rely upon local synthesis of T 3 from T4. Despite\nthis, marked changes in the T 3–T4 ratio as a consequence of a reduced sele-\nnium status (when iodine supplies are also marginal) indicate the modifying\ninﬂuence of selenium on thyroid hormone balance in both animal models and\nhuman subjects. The possible signiﬁcance of this can be anticipated from the\nfact that whereas thyroid weights increase typically by 50% in rats offered an\niodine-deﬁcient diet, thyroid weight is increased 154% by diets concurrently\ndeﬁcient in both selenium and iodine (see also section 10.2.5).\nBetween 60% and 80% of selenium in human plasma is accounted for by\na well-characterized fraction designated selenoprotein P , the function of\nwhich has yet to be determined. It is thought to be a selenium storage protein\nbecause there is limited evidence that it also has an antioxidant role. At least\n10 other selenoproteins exist, including one which is a component of the mito-\nchondrial capsule of sperm cells, damage to which may account for the devel-\nopment of sperm abnormalities during selenium deﬁciency.

Low selenium contents of some infant for-\nmulae have been reported to reduce infant serum selenium and GSHPx values\nto levels down to one ﬁfth of normal in 5–8-month-old infants ( 12, 13). The\nlow selenium content of many older infant formulae would have not only\nbeen insufﬁcient to meet infant requirements ( 12) but when used to supple-\nment breast milk would have diluted the total selenium intake from maternal\nplus fortiﬁed milk. For this reason it has been recommended that formula\nmilks should provide at least 10 mg selenium/day to complement the mater-\nnal supply of selenium ( 13, 14).\nClinical manifestations of deﬁciency arising from such situations are\nuncommon and poorly deﬁned. They include muscular weakness and myalgia\nwith, in several instances, the development of congestive heart failure. In at\nleast one instance such pathologic signs have developed as a consequence of\na generally inadequate diet providing selenium at less than 10 mg/day. The\nP194-216 3/12/05 17:07 Page 196",

With this last exception, virtually all of the above reports describe\nobservations in subjects under close medical supervision. This may well be\nrelevant to the scarcity of consistent pathological ﬁndings ( 16).\n10.2.2 Keshan disease\nKeshan disease was ﬁrst described in the Chinese medical literature more than\n100 years ago, but not until 40 years after its widespread occurrence in 1935\nwas it discovered that selenium deﬁciency was an important factor in its eti-\nology (3). Endemic in children aged 2–10 years and in women of childbear-\ning age, this disease has a geographic distribution covering localities from\nnorth-east to south-west China. Typical manifestations are fatigue after even\nmild exercise, cardiac arrhythmia and palpitations, loss of appetite, cardiac\ninsufﬁciency, cardiomegaly, and congestive heart failure. Pathological changes\ninclude a multifocal myocardial necrosis and ﬁbrosis. The coronary arteries\nare essentially unaffected. Ultrastructural studies show that membranous\norganelles, such as mitochondria or sarcolemma, are affected earliest. The\ndisease has a marked seasonal ﬂuctuation in incidence (3) and may appear after\nonly 3 months exposure to conditions in localities known to be associated\nwith a high risk of myocarditis ( 3, 8). Once the disease is established, sele-\nnium is of little or no therapeutic value. However, prophylaxis consisting of\noral administration of selenium 3 months before the periods of highest antic-\nipated risk is highly effective.\nAlthough geographic similarities in the distribution of Keshan disease and\nthe selenium- and vitamin E-responsive white muscle disease in animals ﬁrst\nprompted successful investigation of the relevance of a low selenium status,\nevidence has grown steadily that the disease is multifactorial in origin. The\nstrongest suspicions have fallen on the development of a viral myocarditis\nprobably attributable to enhancement of the virulence of a coxsackie virus\nduring its passage through selenium-deﬁcient host tissues ( 17).

In that region, dietary intakes of selenium are inadequate to\nmaintain blood GSHPx activity; biochemical indicators of tissue peroxidative\ndamage are elevated until selenium therapy is initiated ( 8).\n10.2.3 Kaschin-Beck disease\nA selenium-responsive bone and joint disease (osteoarthropathy) has been\ndetected in children aged 5–13 years in China and less extensively in south-\neast Siberia. The disease is characterized by joint necrosis—epiphyseal degen-\neration of the arm and leg joints resulting in structural shortening of the\nﬁngers and long bones with consequent growth retardation and stunting ( 3,\n20). Although not identical to Keshan disease, Kaschin-Beck disease also\noccurs in areas where the availability of soil selenium for crop growth is low.\nThe selenium contents of hair and of whole blood are abnormally low and\nthe blood content of GSHPx is reduced. Although the disease is ameliorated\nby selenium therapy, other factors such as the frequent presence of myco-\ntoxins in cereal grains grown in the area may be involved. A spontaneous\ndecrease in incidence from 1970 (44%) to 1980 (14%) to 1986 (1%) has been\nattributed to general improvements in the nutritional status of Chinese rural\ncommunities (20).\n10.2.4 Selenium status and susceptibility to infection\nAs mentioned previously, expression of the cardiac lesions of Keshan disease\nprobably involve not only the development of selenium deﬁciency but also\ninfection with a coxsackie virus (strain CVB 3/0), initially non-virulent, but\nafter passage through a selenium deﬁcient subject, becoming virulent and\nmyopathogenic. The enhancement of virulence of this RNA virus involves\nmodiﬁcations to the nucleotide sequence of the phenotype which resemble\nthe wild-type virulent strain CVB 3/20 (17).

The\nvirulence of other RNA viruses such as hepatitis B and those associated with\nthe development of haemolytic anaemias are enhanced similarly by a decline\nin selenium status. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet\nresolved. However, there are indications that the loss of protective antioxi-\ndant functions dependent on selenium and vitamin E are both involved and\nthat the resulting structural changes in viral nucleotide sequences are repro-\nducible and appear to provoke additional selenoprotein synthesis ( 26). It is\nsuspected that this further depletes previously diminished pools of physio-\nlogically available selenium and accelerates pathological responses ( 27–29).\nWhatever mechanisms are involved, further understanding is needed of the\ninﬂuence of selenium status on susceptibility to viral diseases ranging from\ncardiomyopathies to haemolytic anaemias. The relationship already illustrates\nthe difﬁculty of deﬁning essential requirements of nutrients which may pri-\nmarily maintain defences against infection. Studies of the effects of selenium\ndeﬁciency in several experimental animal species have shown that the micro-\nbicidal activity of blood neutrophils is severely impaired even though phago-\ncytic activity remains unchanged ( 30, 31). The complexity of species\ndifferences in the inﬂuence of selenium status on the effectiveness of cell-\nmediated immune processes is summarized elsewhere ( 8).\nThe possibility that increased intakes of selenium might protect against the\ndevelopment of cancer in humans has generated great interest ( 32). Although\na number of epidemiological studies have reported no relationship between\nselenium and cancer risk ( 33), an analysis of the relationship between sele-\nnium and cancer suggests that the question of “whether selenium protects\nagainst cancer” is still wide open (34).

Decreases in\nthe T3–T4 ratio indicative of decreased thyroid hormone balance have been\ndetected when serum selenium falls below 0.9 mmol/l (37). In a recent Scot-\ntish study, these decreases were correlated with a decline in dietary and plasma\nselenium after the replacement of selenium-rich wheat from Canada and the\nUnited States with selenium-deﬁcient wheat from European sources ( 38).\nCommunities noted for a high incidence of myxedematous cretinism have\nbeen found to have low plasma selenium status, low GSHPx activity, and low\niodine status ( 39), in addition to being exposed to high thiocyanate intakes\nfrom cassava. Restoration of iodine supply, particularly if excessive, tends to\ninduce a high peroxidative stress, through the action of iodide peroxidase in\nthe ﬁrst step in iodine utilization by the thyroid. It is postulated that necro-\nsis and thyroid ﬁbrosis leading to irreversible hypothyroidism result if a con-\ncurrent deﬁciency of selenium limits peroxide destruction by the protective\naction of the selenium-dependent enzymes, GSHPx and, more probably,\nthioredoxin reductase ( 40). In areas where myxedematous cretinism is\nendemic and characterized by persistent hypothyroidism, dwarﬁsm, and\nstunting, it has been recommended that attempts to introduce iodine therapy\nfor mildly affected individuals should be preceded by an assessment of sele-\nnium status and rectiﬁcation of any observed deﬁcit ( 39).

Therefore, the rate-limiting step determining the overall\navailability of dietary selenium is not likely to be its absorption but rather its\nconversion within tissues to its metabolically active forms (e.g. its incorpora-\ntion into GSHPx or 5 ¢-deiodinase) ( 40). A number of depletion–repletion\nexperiments have been carried out on animals to estimate the bioavailability\nof selenium in human foods ( 81). Based on the restoration of GSHPx activ-\nity in depleted rats, the bioavailability of selenium in wheat is quite good,\nusually 80%, or better. The selenium in Brazil nuts and beef kidney also\nappears readily available (90% or more by most criteria). The selenium in\ntuna seems to be less available (perhaps only 20–60% of that absorbed from\nselenite) than selenium from certain other seafoods (e.g. shrimp, crab, and\nBaltic herring). The selenium in a variety of mushrooms appears to be of uni-\nformly low availability to rats.\nData on the nutritional bioavailability of selenium to humans are sparse. A\nsupplementation study carried out on Finnish men of relatively low selenium\nstatus showed that selenate selenium was as effective as the selenium in\nseleniferous wheat in increasing platelet GSHPx activity ( 82). The wheat\nselenium, however, increased plasma selenium levels more than did selenate\nselenium; and once the supplements were withdrawn, platelet GSHPx\nactivity declined less in the group given wheat. This study showed the impor-\ntance of estimating not only short-term availability but also long-term reten-\ntion and the convertibility of tissue selenium stores into biologically active\nforms.\n10.5 Criteria for assessing selenium requirements\nLevander (83) convincingly illustrated the impracticability of assessing sele-\nnium requirements from input–output balance data because the history of\nselenium nutrition",

These comprehensive biochemical and\nclinical studies showed that Keshan disease did not occur in regions where\nthe mean intake of selenium by adult males or females was greater than 19.1\nor 13.3 mg/day, respectively. Although these intakes were sufﬁcient to elimi-\nnate clinical evidence of myocarditis and other signs of Keshan disease, other\nstudies showed that they were inadequate to restore erythrocyte or plasma\nselenium concentrations or GSHPx activities to levels indicative of reserves.\nIn one study adult male subjects, initially of low selenium status, were given\na carefully monitored diet providing selenium at 11mg/day together with sup-\nplements of selenomethionine given orally which provided 0, 10, 30, 60, or\n90mg/day. Starting at overtly deﬁcient levels, total daily selenium intakes\nof above 41 mg/day were found sufﬁcient to increase plasma GSHPx sub-\nstantially and to saturate plasma activity in 60-kg male subjects within\n5–8 months.

For this reason the European Union Scientiﬁc Committee for\nFood ( 89), the United Kingdom Committee on Medical Aspects of Food\nPolicy (90), and the Netherlands Food and Nutrition Council ( 91) have sug-\ngested that the component of selenium needed for human pregnancy is\nobtained by an adaptive increase in the efﬁciency of absorption of dietary sele-\nnium rather than by an increased dietary demand.\nOthers, contesting this view, have attempted to predict the increase\nof dietary selenium needed for pregnancy by factorial estimation of the\nlikely quantity of selenium incorporated into the tissues of the fetus ( 60, 85).\nSuch estimates have assumed that the total products of conception amount\nto 4.6–6kg lean tissue with a protein content of approximately 18.5–20%. If,\nas appears to be a reasonable assumption, the selenium content of this pro-\ntein resembles that of a skeletal muscle, growth of these tissues could\naccount for between 1.0 and 4.5 mg/day of selenium depending on whether\nthe analyses reﬂect consumption of diets from a low-selenium (but non-\npathogenic) environment such as that found in New Zealand (52, 53) or from\na region with relatively high selenium intakes, such as the United States\n(see Table 10.3) ( 54, 55).

Common clinical features are\nhair loss and structural changes in the keratin of hair and nails, the develop-\nment of icteroid skin, and gastrointestinal disturbances (92, 93).

    "text": "11. Magnesium\n11.1 Tissue distribution and biological role of magnesium\nThe human body contains about 760mg of magnesium at birth, approximately\n5g at age 4–5 months, and 25g when adult ( 1–3). Of the body’s magnesium,\n30–40% is found in muscles and soft tissues, 1% is found in extracellular ﬂuid,\nand the remainder is in the skeleton, where it accounts for up to 1% of bone\nash (4, 5).\nSoft tissue magnesium functions as a cofactor of many enzymes involved in\nenergy metabolism, protein synthesis, RNA and DNA synthesis, and mainte-\nnance of the electrical potential of nervous tissues and cell membranes. Of par-\nticular importance with respect to the pathological effects of magnesium\ndepletion is the role of this element in regulating potassium ﬂuxes and its\ninvolvement in the metabolism of calcium ( 6–8). Magnesium depletion\ndepresses both cellular and extracellular potassium and exacerbates the effects\nof low-potassium diets on cellular potassium content. Muscle potassium\nbecomes depleted as magnesium deﬁciency develops, and tissue repletion of\npotassium is virtually impossible unless magnesium status is restored to normal.\nIn addition, low plasma calcium often develops as magnesium status declines.\nIt is not clear whether this occurs because parathyroid hormone release is inhib-\nited or, more probably, because of a reduced sensitivity of bone to parathyroid\nhormone, thus restricting withdrawal of calcium from the skeletal matrix.\nBetween 50% and 60% of body magnesium is located within bone, where\nit is thought to form a surface constituent of the hydroxyapatite (calcium\nphosphate) mineral component. Initially much of this magnesium is readily\nexchangeable with serum and therefore represents a moderately accessible\nmagnesium store which can be drawn on in times of deﬁciency. However, the\nproportion of bone magnesium in this exchangeable form declines signiﬁ-\ncantly with increasing age ( 9).\nSigniﬁcant increases in bone mineral density of the femur have been asso-\nciated positively with rises in erythrocyte magnesium when the diets of sub-\njects with gluten-sensitive enteropathy were fortiﬁed with magnesium ( 10).\nLittle is known of other roles for magnesium in skeletal",

Susceptibility to the effects of magnesium\ndeﬁciency rises when demands for magnesium increase markedly with the\nresumption of tissue growth during rehabilitation from general malnutrition\n(6, 13). Studies have shown that a decline in urinary magnesium excretion\nduring protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) is accompanied by a reduced\nintestinal absorption of magnesium. The catch-up growth associated with\nrecovery from PEM is achieved only if magnesium supply is increased sub-\nstantially (6, 14).\nMost of the early pathological consequences of depletion are neurologic or\nneuromuscular defects (12, 15), some of which probably reﬂect the inﬂuence\nof magnesium on potassium ﬂux within tissues. Thus, a decline in magnesium\nstatus produces anorexia, nausea, muscular weakness, lethargy, staggering,\nand, if deﬁciency is prolonged, weight loss. Progressively increasing with the\nseverity and duration of depletion are manifestations of hyperirritability,\nhyperexcitability, muscular spasms, and tetany, leading ultimately to convul-\nsions. An increased susceptibility to audiogenic shock is common in experi-\nmental animals. Cardiac arrhythmia and pulmonary oedema frequently have\nfatal consequences ( 12). It has been suggested that a suboptimal magnesium\nstatus may be a factor in the etiology of coronary heart disease and hyper-\ntension but additional evidence is needed ( 16).\n11.3 Dietary sources, absorption, and excretion of\nmagnesium\nDietary deﬁciency of magnesium of a severity sufﬁcient to provoke patho-\nlogical changes is rare.

However, consumption of\nphytate- and cellulose-rich products increases magnesium intake (as they\nusually contain high concentrations of magnesium) which often compensates\nfor the decrease in absorption. The effects of dietary components such as\nphytate on magnesium absorption are probably critically important only\nwhen magnesium intake is low. There is no consistent evidence that modest\nincreases in the intake of calcium (34–36), iron, or manganese (22) affect mag-\nnesium balance. In contrast, high intakes of zinc (142mg/day) decrease mag-\nnesium absorption and contribute to a shift towards negative balance in adult\nmales (41).\nThe kidney has a very signiﬁcant role in magnesium homeostasis. Active\nreabsorption of magnesium takes place in the loop of Henle in the proximal\nconvoluted tubule and is inﬂuenced by both the urinary concentration of\nsodium and probably by acid–base balance ( 42). The latter relationship may\nwell account for the observation drawn from Chinese studies that dietary\nchanges which result in increased urinary pH and decreased titratable acidity\nalso reduce urinary magnesium output by 35% despite marked increases in\nmagnesium input from vegetable protein diets ( 25). Several studies have now\nshown that dietary calcium intakes in excess of 2600mg/day (37), particularly\nif associated with high sodium intakes, contribute to a shift towards negative\nmagnesium balance or enhance its urinary output ( 42, 43).\n11.4 Criteria for assessing magnesium requirements\nand allowances\nIn 1996, Shils and Rude ( 44) published a constructive review of past proce-\ndures used to derive estimates of magnesium requirements. They questioned\nthe view of many authors that metabolic balance studies are probably the only\npracticable, non-invasive techniques for assessing the relationship of magne-\nsium intake to magnesium status. At the same time, they emphasized the great\nscarcity of data on variations in urinary magnesium output and on magne-\nsium levels in serum, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, bone, and soft tissues. Such\ndata are needed to verify current assumptions that pathological responses to\na decline in magnesium supply are not likely to occur if magnesium balance\nremains relatively constant.\nIn view of Shils",

Using experimental data virtually identical to those\nused for a detailed critique of the basis for United States estimates ( 44), the\nScientiﬁc Committee for Food of the European Communities ( 46) proposed\nan acceptable range of intakes for adults of 150–500mg/day and described a\nseries of quasi-population reference intakes for speciﬁc age groups, which\nincluded an increment of 30% to allow for individual variations in growth.\nStatements of acceptable intakes such as these leave uncertainty as to the\nextent of overestimation of derived recommended intakes.\nIt is questionable whether more reliable estimates of magnesium require-\nments can be made until data from balance studies are supported by the use\nof biochemical indexes of adequacy that could reveal the development of\nmanifestations of suboptimal status.

The inadequate deﬁni-\ntion of lower acceptable limits of magnesium intake raises concern in\ncommunities or individuals suffering from malnutrition or a wider variety of\nnutritional or other diseases which inﬂuence magnesium metabolism\nadversely (12, 51, 52).\n11.5 Recommended intakes for magnesium\nThe infrequency with which magnesium deﬁciency develops in human-\nmilk-fed infants implies that the content and physiological availability of mag-\nnesium in human milk meets the infants’ requirements. The intake of mater-\nnal milk from exclusively human-milk-fed infants 1–10 months of age ranges\nfrom 700 to 900ml/day in both industrialized and developing countries ( 53).\nIf the magnesium content of milk is assumed to be 29mg/l ( 11, 54, 55), the\nintake from milk is 20–26mg/day, or approximately 0.04mg/kcal.\nThe magnesium in human milk is absorbed with substantially greater efﬁ-\nciency (about 80–90%) than that of formula milks (about 55–75%) or solid\nfoods (about 50%) (56), and such differences must be taken into account when\ncomparing differing dietary sources. For example, a daily intake of 23mg from\nmaternal milk probably yields 18mg available magnesium, a quantity similar\nto that of the 36mg or more suggested as meeting the requirements of young\ninfants given formula or other foods (see below).\nAn indication of a likely requirement for magnesium at other ages can\nbe derived from studies of magnesium–potassium relationships in muscle\n(57) and the clinical recovery of young children rehabilitated from malnutri-\ntion with or without magnesium fortiﬁcation of therapeutic diets.

Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately\n60% of the total body content and bone mass, with a zinc concen-\ntration of 1.5–3 mmol/g (100–200 mg/g), for approximately 30%. The concen-\ntration of zinc in lean body mass is approximately 0.46 mmol/g (30 mg/g).\nPlasma zinc has a rapid turnover rate and it represents only about 0.l% of total\nbody zinc content. This level appears to be under close homeostatic control.\nHigh concentrations of zinc are found in the choroid of the eye (4.2 mmol/g\nor 274 mg/g) and in prostatic ﬂuids (4.6–7.7mmol/l or 300–500mg/l) ( 1).\nZinc is an essential component of a large number ( >300) of enzymes\nparticipating in the synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates, lipids,\nproteins, and nucleic acids as well as in the metabolism of other micronutri-\nents. Zinc stabilizes the molecular structure of cellular components and mem-\nbranes and in this way contributes to the maintenance of cell and organ\nintegrity. Furthermore, zinc has an essential role in polynucleotide transcrip-\ntion and thus in the process of genetic expression. Its involvement in such\nfundamental activities probably accounts for the essentiality of zinc for all life\nforms.\nZinc plays a central role in the immune system, affecting a number of\naspects of cellular and humoral immunity ( 2). Shankar and Prasad have\nreviewed the role of zinc in immunity extensively ( 2).\nThe clinical features of severe zinc deﬁciency in humans are growth retar-\ndation, delayed sexual and bone maturation, skin lesions, diarrhoea, alopecia,\nimpaired appetite, increased susceptibility to infections mediated via defects\nin the immune system, and the appearance of behavioural changes ( 1).

    "text": "12.2 Zinc metabolism and homeostasis\nZinc absorption is concentration dependent and occurs throughout the\nsmall intestine. Under normal physiological conditions, transport processes\nof uptake are not saturated. Zinc administered in aqueous solutions to fasting\nsubjects is absorbed efﬁciently (60–70%), whereas absorption from solid diets\nis less efﬁcient and varies depending on zinc content and diet composition (3).\nThe major losses of zinc from the body are through the intestine and urine,\nby desquamation of epithelial cells, and in sweat. Endogenous intestinal losses\ncan vary from 7mmol/day (0.5mg/day) to more than 45 mmol/day (3mg/day),\ndepending on zinc intake—the higher the intake, the greater the losses ( 4).\nUrinary and integumental losses are of the order of 7–10 mmol/day (0.5–\n0.7mg/day) each and depend less on normal variations in zinc intake ( 4).\nStarvation and muscle catabolism increase zinc losses in urine. Strenuous\nexercise and elevated ambient temperatures can lead to high losses through\nperspiration.\nThe body has no zinc stores in the conventional sense. In conditions of\nbone resorption and tissue catabolism, zinc is released and may be reutilized\nto some extent. Human experimental studies with low zinc diets containing\n2.6–3.6mg/day (40–55 mmol/day) have shown that circulating zinc levels and\nactivities of zinc-containing enzymes can be maintained within a normal range\nover several months (5, 6), a ﬁnding which highlights the efﬁciency of the zinc\nhomeostasis mechanism. Controlled depletion–repletion studies in humans\nhave shown that changes in the endogenous excretion of intestinal, urinary,\nand integumental zinc as well as changes in absorptive efﬁciency are how\nbody zinc content is maintained (7–10). However, the underlying mechanisms\nare poorly understood.\nSensitive indexes for assessing zinc status are unknown at present. Static\nindexes, such as zinc concentration in plasma, blood cells, and hair, and\nurinary zinc excretion are decreased in severe zinc deﬁciency.

A number of\nconditions that are unrelated to zinc status can affect all these indexes, espe-\ncially zinc plasma levels.

However, on a population basis, reduced plasma\nzinc concentrations seem to be a marker for zinc-responsive growth reduc-\ntions ( 12, 13). Experimental zinc depletion studies suggest that changes in\nimmune response occur before reductions in plasma zinc concentrations\nare apparent ( 14). To date, it has not been possible to identify zinc-\ndependent enzymes which could serve as early markers for zinc status.\nA number of functional indexes of zinc status have been suggested, for\nexample, wound healing, taste acuity, and visual adaptation to the dark ( 11).\n12.

Estimations of the turnover rates\nof administered isotopes in plasma or urine have revealed the existence of a\nrelatively small but rapidly exchangeable body pool of zinc of about\n1.5–3.0mmol (100–200mg) ( 16–19). The size of the pool seems to be corre-\nlated to habitual dietary intake and it is reduced in controlled depletion studies\n(18). The zinc pool was also found to be correlated to endogenous intestinal\nexcretion of zinc (19) and to total daily absorption of zinc. These data suggest\nthat the size of the pool depends on recently absorbed zinc and that a larger\nexchangeable pool results in larger endogenous excretion. Changes in endoge-\nnous intestinal excretion of zinc seem to be more important than changes in\nabsorptive efﬁciency for maintenance of zinc homeostasis ( 19).\n12.3 Dietary sources and bioavailability of zinc\nLean red meat, whole-grain cereals, pulses, and legumes provide the highest\nconcentrations of zinc: concentrations in such foods are generally in the range\nof 25–50mg/kg (380–760 mmol/kg) raw weight. Processed cereals with low\nextraction rates, polished rice, and chicken, pork or meat with high fat content\nhave a moderate zinc content, typically between 10 and 25mg/kg (150–380\nmmol/kg). Fish, roots and tubers, green leafy vegetables, and fruits are only\nmodest sources of zinc, having concentrations <10mg/kg ( <150mmol/kg)\n(20). Saturated fats and oils, sugar, and alcohol have very low zinc contents.\nThe utilization of zinc depends on the overall composition of the diet.\nExperimental studies have identiﬁed a number of dietary factors as potential\npromoters or antagonists of zinc absorption ( 21).

Soluble organic substances\nof low relative molecular mass, such as amino and hydroxy acids, facilitate\nzinc absorption. In contrast, organic compounds forming stable and poorly\nsoluble complexes with zinc can impair absorption. In addition, competitive\ninteractions between zinc and other ions with similar physicochemical prop-\nerties can affect the uptake and intestinal absorption of zinc. The risk of com-\npetitive interactions with zinc seems to be mainly related to the consumption\nof high doses of these other ions, in the form of supplements or in aqueous\nsolutions. However, at levels present in food and at realistic fortiﬁcation\nlevels, zinc absorption appears not to be affected, for example, by iron or\ncopper (21).\nP230-245 3/12/05 17:09 Page 232",

    "text": "Isotope studies with human subjects have identiﬁed two factors that,\ntogether with the total zinc content of the diet, are major determinants of\nabsorption and utilization of dietary zinc. The ﬁrst is the content of inositol\nhexaphosphate (phytate) in the diet and the second is the level and source of\ndietary protein. Phytates are present in whole-grain cereals and legumes\nand in smaller amounts in other vegetables. They have a strong potential for\nbinding divalent cations and their depressive effect on zinc absorption has\nbeen demonstrated in humans (21). The molar ratio between phytates and zinc\nin meals or diets is a useful indicator of the effect of phytates in depressing\nzinc absorption. At molar ratios above the range of 6–10, zinc absorption\nstarts to decline; at ratios above 15, absorption is typically less than 15% (20).\nThe effect of phytate is, however, modiﬁed by the source and amount of\ndietary proteins consumed. Animal proteins improve zinc absorption from a\nphytate-containing diet (22). Zinc absorption from some legume-based diets\n(e.g. white beans and lupin protein) is comparable with that from animal-\nprotein-based diets despite a higher phytate content in the former ( 22, 23).\nHigh dietary calcium potentiated the antagonistic effects of phytates on zinc\nabsorption in experimental studies. The results from human studies are less\nconsistent and any effects seem to depend on the source of calcium and the\ncomposition of the diet ( 21, 23).\nSeveral recently published absorption studies illustrate the effect of zinc\ncontent and diet composition on fractional zinc absorption ( 19, 24–26). The\nresults from the total diet studies, where all main meals of a day’s intake were\nextrinsically labelled, show a remarkable consistency in fractional absorption\ndespite relatively large variations in meal composition and zinc content (see\nTable 12.1). Thus, approximately twice as much zinc is absorbed from a non-\nvegetarian or high-meat diet (25, 26) than from a diet based on rice and wheat\nﬂour ( 19). Data are lacking on zinc absorption from typical diets of develop-\ning countries, which usually have high phytate contents.\nThe availability of zinc from the diet",

Lower extraction\nrates of cereal grains will result in lower phytate content but at the same time\nthe zinc content is reduced, so that the net effect on zinc supply is limited.\nThe phytate content can be reduced by activating the phytase present in most\nphytate-containing foods or through the addition of microbial or fungal phy-\ntases. Phytases hydrolyse the phytate to lower inositol phosphates, resulting\nin improved zinc absorption ( 27, 28). The activity of phytases in tropical\ncereals such as maize and sorghum is lower than that in wheat and rye ( 29).\nGermination of cereals and legumes increases phytase activity and addition of\nsome germinated ﬂour to ungerminated maize or sorghum followed by\n12.

To estimate the normative maintenance require-\nments for other age groups, the respective basal metabolic rates were used for\nextrapolation. In growing individuals the rate of accretion and zinc content\nof newly-formed tissues were used to derive estimates of requirements for\ntissue growth. Similarly, the retention of zinc during pregnancy ( 35) and the\nzinc concentration in milk at different stages of lactation ( 36) were used to\nestimate the physiological requirements in pregnancy and lactation.\nThe translation of these estimates of absorbed zinc into requirements for\ndietary zinc involves several considerations. First, the nature of the diet (i.e.\nits content of promoters and inhibitors of zinc absorption) determines the\nfraction of the dietary zinc that is potentially absorbable. Second, the efﬁ-\nciency of absorption of potentially available zinc is inversely related to the\ncontent of zinc in the diet. The review of available data from experimental\nzinc absorption studies of single meals or total diets resulted in a division of\ndiets into three categories—high, moderate, and low zinc bioavailability—as\ndetailed in Table 12.2 ( 33). To take account of the fact that the relationship\nbetween efﬁciency of absorption and zinc content differs for these diets, algo-\nrithms were developed ( 33) and applied to the estimates of requirements for\nabsorbed zinc to achieve a set of ﬁgures for the average individual dietary zinc\nrequirements (Table 12.3). The fractional absorption ﬁgures applied for the\nthree diet categories at intakes adequate to meet the normative requirements\nfor absorbed zinc were 50%, 30%, and 15%, respectively.

Because zinc requirements are related to\ntissue turnover rate and growth, it is reasonable to assume that variations in\nphysiological zinc requirements are of the same magnitude as variations in\nprotein requirements (37) and that the same ﬁgure (12.5%) for the interindi-\nvidual coefﬁcient of variation (CV) could be adopted. However, unlike\nprotein requirements, the derivation of dietary zinc requirements involves\nestimating absorption efﬁciences. Consequently, variations in absorptive efﬁ-\nciency, not relevant in relation to estimates of protein requirements, may have\nto be taken into account in the estimates of the total interindividual variation\nin zinc requirements. Systematic studies of the interindividual variations in\nzinc absorption under different conditions are few.

Low\ncopper and ceruloplasmin levels and anaemia have been observed after zinc\nintakes of 450–660mg/day (6.9–10mmol/day) (41, 42). Changes in serum lipid\npattern and in immune response have also been observed in zinc supplemen-\ntation studies ( 43, 44). Because copper also has a central role in immune\ndefence, these observations should be studied further before large-scale zinc\nsupplementation programmes are undertaken.

    "text": "13. Iron\n13.1 Role of iron in human metabolic processes\nIron has several vital functions in the body. It serves as a carrier of oxygen to\nthe tissues from the lungs by red blood cell haemoglobin, as a transport\nmedium for electrons within cells, and as an integrated part of important\nenzyme systems in various tissues. The physiology of iron has been exten-\nsively reviewed (1–6).\nMost of the iron in the body is present in the erythrocytes as haemoglo-\nbin, a molecule composed of four units, each containing one haem group and\none protein chain. The structure of haemoglobin allows it to be fully loaded\nwith oxygen in the lungs and partially unloaded in the tissues (e.g. in the\nmuscles). The iron-containing oxygen storage protein in the muscles, myo-\nglobin, is similar in structure to haemoglobin but has only one haem unit and\none globin chain. Several iron-containing enzymes, the cytochromes, also\nhave one haem group and one globin protein chain. These enzymes act as\nelectron carriers within the cell and their structures do not permit reversible\nloading and unloading of oxygen. Their role in the oxidative metabolism is to\ntransfer energy within the cell and speciﬁcally in the mitochondria. Other key\nfunctions for the iron-containing enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450) include the\nsynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids; detoxiﬁcation of foreign sub-\nstances in the liver; and signal controlling in some neurotransmitters, such as\nthe dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain.

However, new studies which took extensive\nprecautions to avoid the interference of contamination of iron from the skin\nduring the collection of total body sweat have shown that sweat iron losses\nare negligible (9).\n13.2.2 Requirements for growth\nThe newborn term infant has an iron content of about 250–300mg (75mg/kg\nbody weight). During the ﬁrst 2 months of life, haemoglobin concentration\nfalls because of the improved oxygen situation in the newborn infant com-\npared with the intrauterine fetus. This leads to a considerable redistribution\nof iron from catabolized erythrocytes to iron stores. This iron will cover the\nneeds of the term infant during the ﬁrst 4–6 months of life and is why iron\nrequirements during this period can be provided by human milk, which con-\ntains very little iron. Because of the marked supply of iron to the fetus during\nthe last trimester of pregnancy, the iron situation is much less favourable in\nthe premature and low-birth-weight infant than in the healthy term infant.\nAn extra supply of iron is therefore needed in these infants during the ﬁrst 6\nmonths of life.\nIn the term infant, iron requirements rise markedly after age 4–6 months\nand amount to about 0.7–0.9mg/day during the remaining part of the ﬁrst\nyear. These requirements are very high, especially in relation to body size and\nenergy intake (Table 13.1) (10).\nIn the ﬁrst year of life, the term infant almost doubles its total iron stores\nand triples its body weight. The increase in body iron during this period\noccurs mainly during the latter 6 months. Between 1 and 6 years of age, the\nbody iron content is again doubled. The requirements for absorbed iron in\ninfants and children are very high in relation to their energy requirements.\nFor example, in infants 6–12 months of age, about 1.5mg of iron need to be\nabsorbed per 4.184 MJ and about half of this",

(This statement disre-\ngards infestations with hookworms and other parasites.) The mean menstrual\niron loss, averaged over the entire menstrual cycle of 28 days, is about\n0.56mg/day. The frequency distribution of physiological menstrual blood\nlosses is highly skewed. Adding the average basal iron loss (0.8mg/day) and\nits variation allows the distribution of the total iron requirements in adult\nwomen to be calculated as the convolution of the distributions of menstrual\nand basal iron losses (Figure 13.2). The mean daily total iron requirement is\n1.36mg. In 10% of women, it exceeds 2.27mg and in 5% it exceeds 2.84mg\n(19). In 10% of menstruating (still-growing) teenagers, the corresponding\ndaily total iron requirement exceeds 2.65mg, and in 5% of girls, it exceeds\n3.2mg. The marked skewness of menstrual losses is a great nutritional\nproblem because assessment of an individual’s iron losses is unreliable. This\nmeans that women with physiological but heavy losses cannot be identiﬁed\nand reached by iron supplementation. The choice of contraceptive method\nalso greatly inﬂuences menstrual losses.\nIn postmenopausal women and in physically active elderly people, the iron\nrequirements per unit of body weight are the same as in men. When physical\nactivity decreases as a result of ageing, blood volume decreases and haemo-\nglobin mass diminishes, leading to a shift of iron usage from haemoglobin and\nmuscle to iron stores. This implies a reduction of the daily iron requirements.\nIron deﬁciency in the elderly is therefore seldom of nutritional origin but\nis usually caused by pathologic iron losses.\nThe absorbed iron requirements in different groups are summarized in\nTable 13.1.

In bread, some of the phytates in bran are degraded\nduring the fermentation of the dough. Fermentation for a couple of days\n(sourdough fermentation) can almost completely degrade the phytate and\nincrease the bioavailability of iron in bread made from wholewheat ﬂour (32).\nOats strongly inhibit iron absorption because of their high phytate content\nthat results from native phytase in oats being destroyed by the normal heat\nprocess used to avoid rancidity ( 33).

It should be\npointed out that meat also enhances the absorption of haem iron to about the\nsame extent ( 21). Meat thus promotes iron nutrition in two ways: it stimu-\nlates the absorption of both haem and non-haem iron and it provides the well-\nabsorbed haem iron. Epidemiologically, the intake of meat has been found to\nbe associated with a lower prevalence of iron deﬁciency.\nOrganic acids, such as citric acid, have been found to enhance the absorp-\ntion of non-haem iron in some studies (29). This effect is not observed as con-\nsistently as is that of ascorbic acid (47, 52). Sauerkraut (59) and other fermented\nvegetables and even some fermented soy sauces (49, 50) enhance iron absorp-\ntion.

In the ﬁrst\nstudies of this type to be conducted, all non-haem iron in all meals over periods\nof 5–10 days was homogeneously labelled to the same speciﬁc activity with an\nextrinsic inorganic radioiron tracer ( 43, 60). Haem iron absorption was then\nestimated. In a further study, haem and non-haem iron were separately labelled\nwith two radioiron tracers as biosynthetically labelled haemoglobin and as an\ninorganic iron salt (22). These studies showed that new information could be\nobtained, for example, about the average bioavailability of dietary iron in dif-\nferent types of diets, the overall effects of certain factors (e.g. calcium) on iron\nnutrition, and the regulation of iron absorption in relation to iron status. Iron\nabsorption from the whole diet has been extrapolated from the sum of the\nabsorption of iron from the single meals included in the diet. However, it has\nbeen suggested that the iron absorption of single meals may exaggerate the\nabsorption of iron from the whole diet (61, 62), as there is a large variation of\nabsorption between meals. Despite this, studies where all meals in a diet are\nlabelled to the same speciﬁc activity (the same amount of radioactivity in each\nmeal per unit iron) show that the sum of iron absorption from a great number\nof single meals agrees with the total absorption from the diet. One study\nshowed that iron absorption from a single meal was the same when the meal\nwas served in the morning after an overnight fast or at lunch or supper ( 63).\nThe same observation was made in another study when a hamburger meal was\nserved in the morning or 2–4 hours after a breakfast ( 42).\nBecause the sum of energy expenditure and intake set the limit for the\namount of food eaten and for meal size, it is practical to relate the bioavail-\nability of iron in different meals to energy content (i.e. the bioavailable nutri-\nent density).

The iron is released and\ndelivered to transferrin in the plasma, which brings the iron back to red blood\ncell precursors in the bone marrow or to other cells in different tissues.\nUptake and distribution of iron in the body is regulated by the synthesis of\ntransferrin receptors on the cell surface. This system for internal iron trans-\nport not only controls the rate of ﬂow of iron to different tissues according\nto their needs, but also effectively prevents the appearance of free iron and\nthe formation of free radicals in the circulation.\nThe second mechanism involves access to the speciﬁc storage protein, fer-\nritin. This protein stores iron in periods of relatively low need and releases it\nto meet excessive iron demands. This iron reservoir is especially important in\nthe third trimester of pregnancy.\nThe third mechanism involves the regulation of absorption of iron from\nthe intestines; decreasing body iron stores trigger increased iron absorption\nand increasing iron stores trigger decreased iron absorption. Iron absorption\ndecreases until equilibrium is established between absorption and require-\nment. For a given diet this regulation of iron absorption, however, can only\nbalance losses up to a certain critical point beyond which iron deﬁciency will\ndevelop (68). About half of the basal iron losses are from blood and occur\nprimarily in the gastrointestinal tract. Both these losses and the menstrual iron\nlosses are inﬂuenced by the haemoglobin level; during the development of an\niron deﬁciency, menstrual and basal iron losses will successively decrease\nwhen the haemoglobin level decreases. In a state of more severe iron deﬁ-\nciency, skin iron losses may also decrease. Iron balance (absorption equals\nlosses) may be present not only in normal subjects but also during iron deﬁ-\nciency and iron overload.\nThe three main factors that affect iron balance are absorption (intake and\nbioavailability of iron), losses, and stored amount.

The weaning\nperiod in infants is especially critical because of the very high iron require-\nment needed in relation to energy requirement (see section 13.2.2). Thanks to\nbetter information about iron deﬁciency and the addition of fortiﬁed cereals\nto the diets of infants and children, the iron situation has markedly improved\nin these groups in most developed countries, such that the groups currently\nconsidered to be most at risk are menstruating and pregnant women, and ado-\nlescents of both sexes. In developing countries, however, the iron situation is\nstill very critical in many groups—especially in infants in the weaning period.\nDuring this period, iron nutrition is of great importance for the adequate\ndevelopment of the brain and other tissues such as muscles, which are differ-\nentiated early in life.\nIron deﬁciency and iron deﬁciency anaemia are often incorrectly used as\nsynonyms. A deﬁnition of these terms may clarify some of the confusion\nabout different prevalence ﬁgures given in the literature ( 70). Iron deﬁciency\nis deﬁned as a haemoglobin concentration below the optimum value in an\nindividual, whereas iron deﬁciency anaemia implies that the haemoglobin\nconcentration is below the 95th percentile of the distribution of haemoglobin\nconcentration in a population (disregarding effects of altitude, age and sex, etc.\non haemoglobin concentration). The confusion arises due to the very wide\ndistribution of the haemoglobin concentration in healthy, fully iron-replete\nsubjects (in women, 120–160g/l; in men, 140–180g/l) ( 71).

In turn, this will lead to an overlap in the dis-\ntributions of haemoglobin in iron-deﬁcient and iron-replete women (Figure\n13.4).

In populations with more severe iron deﬁciency, for example, the\noverlap is much less marked.\nIn women, anaemia is deﬁned as a haemoglobin level <120g/l. For a\nwoman who has her normal homeostatic value set at 150g/l, her haemoglo-\nbin level must decrease by 26% to 119g/l before she is considered to be\nanaemic, whereas for a woman who has her normal haemoglobin set at\n121g/l, her haemoglobin level must only decrease by 1.5% to 119g/l.

By deﬁnition, this\nimplies that the prevalence of iron deﬁciency anaemia is less frequent than\niron deﬁciency and that the presence of anaemia in a subject is a statistical\nrather than a functional concept. The main use of the cut-off value in deﬁn-\ning anaemia is in comparisons between population groups ( 72). In practical\nwork, iron deﬁciency anaemia should be replaced by the functional concept\nof iron deﬁciency.

At this point, insufﬁcient amounts of iron will\nbe delivered to transferrin, the circulating transport protein for iron, and the\nbinding sites for iron on transferrin will therefore contain less and less iron.\nThis is usually described as a reduction in transferrin saturation. When trans-\nferrin saturation drops to a certain critical level, erythrocyte precursors, which\ncontinuously need iron for the formation of haemoglobin, will get an insuf-\nﬁcient supply of iron. At the same time, the supply of iron by transferrin to\nother tissues will also be impaired. Liver cells will get less iron, more trans-\nferrin will be synthesized, and the concentration of transferrin in plasma will\nthen suddenly increase. Cells with a high turnover rate are the ﬁrst ones to\nbe affected (e.g. intestinal mucosal cells with a short lifespan). The iron–trans-\nferrin complex binds to transferrin receptors on certain cell surfaces and is\nthen taken up by invagination of the whole complex on the cell wall. The\nuptake of iron seems to be related both to transferrin saturation and the\nnumber of transferrin receptors on the cell surface (73, 74). There is a marked\ndiurnal variation in the saturation of transferrin because the turnover rate of\niron in plasma is very high. This fact makes it difﬁcult to evaluate the iron\nstatus from single determinations of transferrin saturation.\n13.3.2 Indicators of iron deficiency\nThe absence of iron stores (iron deﬁciency) can be diagnosed by showing that\nthere is no stainable iron in the reticuloendothelial cells in bone marrow\nsmears or, more easily, by a low concentration of ferritin in serum ( <15mg/l).\nEven if an absence of iron stores per se may not necessarily be associated with\nany immediate adverse effects, it is a reliable and good indirect indicator of\niron-deﬁcient erythropoiesis and of an increased risk of a compromised\nsupply of iron to different tissues.\nEven before iron stores are completely exhausted, the supply of iron to the\nerythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow is",

As men-\ntioned above, it can then be assumed that the supply of iron to other tissues\nneeding iron is also insufﬁcient because the identical transport system is used.\nDuring the development of iron deﬁciency haemoglobin concentration, trans-\nferrin concentration, transferrin saturation, transferrin receptors in plasma,\nerythrocyte protoporphyrin, and erythrocyte indexes are changed.

By increasing the number of tests used, the diag-\nnostic speciﬁcity then increases but the sensitivity decreases, and thus the true\nprevalence of iron deﬁciency is markedly underestimated if multiple diag-\nnostic criteria are used. Fortunately, a low serum ferritin ( <15mg/l) is always\nassociated with an iron-deﬁcient erythropoiesis. The use of serum ferritin\nalone as a measure will also underestimate the true prevalence of iron deﬁ-\nciency but to a lesser degree than when the combined criteria are used.\nA diagnosis of iron deﬁciency anaemia can be suspected if anaemia is\npresent in subjects who are iron-deﬁcient as described above. Preferably, to\nfully establish the diagnosis, the subjects should respond adequately to iron\ntreatment. The pitfalls with this method are the random variation in haemo-\nglobin concentrations over time and the effect of the regression towards the\nmean when a new measurement is made.\nThe use of serum ferritin has improved the diagnostic accuracy of iron deﬁ-\nciency. It is the only simple method available to detect early iron deﬁciency.\nIts practical value is somewhat reduced, however, by the fact that serum fer-\nritin is a very sensitive acute-phase reactant and may be increased for weeks\nafter a simple infection with fever for a day or two ( 77).

Gluten\nenteropathy is another possibility to consider, especially in young patients.\n13.3.4 Prevalence of iron deficiency\nIron deﬁciency is probably the most common nutritional deﬁciency disorder\nin the world. A recent estimate based on WHO criteria indicated that around\n600–700 million people worldwide have marked iron deﬁciency anaemia (81),\nand the bulk of these people live in developing countries. In developed coun-\ntries, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency anaemia is much lower and usually\nvaries between 2% and 8%. However, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency,\nincluding both anaemic and non-anaemic subjects (see deﬁnitions above), is\nmuch higher. In developed countries, for example, an absence of iron stores\nor subnormal serum ferritin values is found in about 20–30% of women of\nfertile age. In adolescent girls, the prevalence is even higher.\nIt is difﬁcult to determine the prevalence of iron deﬁciency more exactly\nbecause representative populations for clinical investigation are hard to obtain.\nLaboratory methods and techniques for blood sampling need careful stan-\ndardization.

The physical working\ncapacity of rats is signiﬁcantly reduced in states of iron deﬁciency, especially\nduring endurance activities ( 82, 83). This negative effect seems to be less\nrelated to the degree of anaemia than to impaired oxidative metabolism in the\nmuscles with an increased formation of lactic acid. Thus, the effect witnessed\nseems to be due to a lack of iron-containing enzymes which are rate limiting\nfor oxidative metabolism ( 84). Further to this, several groups have observed\na reduction in physical working capacity in human populations with long-\nstanding iron deﬁciency, and demonstrated an improvement in working\ncapacity in these populations after iron administration ( 84).\nThe relationship between iron deﬁciency and brain function and develop-\nment is very important to consider when choosing a strategy to combat\niron deﬁciency ( 85–88). Several structures in the brain have a high iron con-\ntent; levels are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in the liver.\nThe observation that the lower iron content of the brain in iron-deﬁcient\ngrowing rats cannot be increased by giving iron at a later date strongly sug-\ngests that the supply of iron to brain cells takes place during an early phase\nof brain development and that, as such, early iron deﬁciency may lead to\nirreparable damage to brain cells. In humans about 10% of brain-iron is\npresent at birth; at the age of 10 years the brain has only reached half its\nnormal iron content, and optimal amounts are ﬁrst reached between the ages\nof 20 and 30 years.\nIron deﬁciency also negatively inﬂuences the normal defence systems\nagainst infections.

Therapy-\nresistant behavioural impairment and the fact that there is an accumulation of\niron during the whole period of brain growth should be considered strong\narguments for the early detection and treatment of iron deﬁciency. This is\nvalid for women, especially during pregnancy, and for infants and children,\nup through the period of adolescence to adulthood. In a recent well-\ncontrolled study, administration of iron to non-anaemic but iron-deﬁcient\nadolescent girls improved verbal learning and memory ( 90).\nWell-controlled studies in adolescent girls show that iron-deﬁciency\nwithout anaemia is associated with reduced physical endurance ( 91) and\nchanges in mood and ability to concentrate (92). Another recent study showed\nthat there was a reduction in maximum oxygen consumption in non-anaemic\nwomen with iron deﬁciency that was unrelated to a decreased oxygen-\ntransport capacity of the blood ( 93).\n13.4 Iron requirements during pregnancy and lactation\nIron requirements during pregnancy are well established (Table 13.2). Most\nof the iron required during pregnancy is used to increase the haemoglobin\nmass of the mother; this increase occurs in all healthy pregnant women who\nTABLE 13.2\nIron requirements during pregnancy\nIron requirements\n(mg)\nIron requirements during pregnancy\nFetus 300\nPlacenta 50\nExpansion of maternal erythrocyte mass 450\nBasal iron losses 240\nTotal iron requirement 1040\nNet iron balance after delivery\nContraction of maternal erythrocyte mass +450\nMaternal blood loss -250\nNet iron balance +200\nNet iron requirements for pregnancya 840\na Assuming sufﬁcient material iron stores are present.\nP246-278 3/12/05 17:09 Page 264",

The increased haemoglobin mass is directly proportional to the increased\nneed for oxygen transport during pregnancy and is one of the important phys-\niological adaptations that occurs in pregnancy ( 94, 95). A major problem in\nmaintaining iron balance in pregnancy is that iron requirements are not\nequally distributed over its duration. The exponential growth of the fetus in\nthe last trimester of pregnancy means that more than 80% of fetal iron needs\nrelate to this period. The total daily iron requirements, including the basal\niron losses (0.8mg), increase during pregnancy from 0.8mg to about 10mg\nduring the last 6 weeks of pregnancy.\nIn lactating women, the daily iron loss in milk is about 0.3mg. Together\nwith the basal iron losses of 0.8mg, the total iron requirements during the lac-\ntation period amount to 1.1mg/day.\nIron absorption during pregnancy is determined by the amount of iron in\nthe diet, its bioavailability (meal composition), and the changes in iron absorp-\ntion that occur during pregnancy. There are marked changes in the fraction\nof iron absorbed during pregnancy. In the ﬁrst trimester, there is a marked,\nsomewhat paradoxical, decrease in the absorption of iron, which is closely\nrelated to the reduction in iron requirements during this period as compared\nwith the non-pregnant state (see below). In the second trimester, iron absorp-\ntion is increased by about 50%, and in the last trimester it may increase by\nup to about four times the norm. Even considering the marked increase in\niron absorption, it is impossible for the mother to cover her iron requirements\nfrom diet alone, even if her diet’s iron content and bioavailability are very\nhigh. In diets prevailing in most developed countries, there will be a deﬁcit\nof about 400–500mg in the amount of iron absorbed versus required during\npregnancy (Figure 13.5).\nAn adequate iron balance can be achieved if iron stores of 500mg are avail-\nable during the second and third trimesters.

In the non-\nanaemic pregnant woman, daily supplements of 100mg of iron (e.g. as ferrous\nsulphate) given during the second half of pregnancy are adequate.

An extensive study ( 96) showed that a woman with a haematocrit of\n37% had twice the risk of having a premature birth, as did a woman with a\nhaematocrit between 41% and 44% ( P £ 0.01).

There is, for example, a very early increase in the\nplasma volume, which has been used to explain the physiological anaemia of\npregnancy observed in iron-replete women. The primary cause of this phe-\nnomenon, however, is more probably an increased ability of the haemoglo-\nbin to deliver oxygen to the tissues (fetus). This change is induced early in\npregnancy by increasing the content of 2,3-diphospho-d-glycerate in the ery-\nthrocytes, which shifts the haemoglobin–oxygen dissociation curve to the\nright.

In extensive studies of preg-\nnant women, a U-shaped relationship between various pregnancy\ncomplications and the haemoglobin level has been noted (i.e. there are more\ncomplications at both low and high levels). There is nothing to indicate,\nhowever, that high haemoglobin levels (within the normal non-pregnant\nrange) per se have any negative effects. The haemoglobin increase is caused\nby pathologic hormonal and haemodynamic changes induced by an increased\nsensitivity to angiotensin II, which occurs in some pregnant women, leading\nto a reduction in plasma volume, hypertension, and toxaemia of pregnancy.\nPregnancy in adolescents presents a special problem because iron is needed\nto cover the requirements of growth for the mother and the fetus. In coun-\ntries with very early marriage, a girl may get pregnant before menstruating.\nThe combined iron requirements for growth and pregnancy are very high and\nthe iron situation is very serious for these adolescents.\nIn summary, the physiological adjustments occurring in pregnancy are not\nsufﬁcient to balance its very marked iron requirements, and the pregnant\nwoman has to rely on her iron stores. In developed countries, the composi-\ntion of the diet has not been adjusted to the present low-energy-demanding\nlifestyles found there. As a result, women in these countries have insufﬁcient\nor empty iron stores during pregnancy. This is probably the main cause of the\ncritical iron-balance situation in pregnant women in these countries today.\nThe unnatural necessity to give extra nutrients such as iron and folate to oth-\nerwise healthy pregnant women should be considered in this perspective.\n13.5 Iron supplementation and fortification\nThe prevention of iron deﬁciency has become more urgent in recent years\nwith the accumulation of evidence strongly suggesting a relationship between\neven mild iron deﬁciency and impaired brain development, and especially so\nin view of the observation that functional defects affecting learning and behav-\niour cannot be reversed by giving iron at a later date.

The solutions are therefore often quite\ndifferent in developing and developed countries. There is a need to obtain new\nknowledge about the feasibility of different methods to improve iron nutri-\ntion and to apply present knowledge in more effective ways. Further to this,\ninitiation of local activities on the issue of iron nutrition should be stimulated\nwhile actions from governments are awaited.\n13.6 Evidence used for estimating recommended nutrient\nintakes\nTo translate physiological iron requirements, given in Table 13.1, into dietary\niron requirements, the bioavailability of iron in different diets must be calcu-\nlated. It is also necessary to deﬁne an iron status where the supply of iron to\nthe erythrocyte precursors and other tissues begins to be compromised. A\nstate of iron-deﬁcient erythropoiesis occurs when iron can no longer be mobi-\nlized from iron stores; iron can no longer be mobilized when stores are almost\ncompletely empty. A reduction then occurs, for example, in the concentration\nof haemoglobin and in the average content of haemoglobin in the erythro-\ncytes (i.e. a reduction in mean corpuscular haemoglobin). At the same time\nthe concentration of transferrin in the plasma increases because of an insufﬁ-\ncient supply of iron to liver cells. These changes were recently shown to occur\nrather suddenly at a level of serum ferritin <15mg/l (68, 70). A continued neg-\native iron balance will further reduce the level of haemoglobin. Symptoms\nrelated to iron deﬁciency are less related to the haemoglobin level and more\nto the fact that there is a compromised supply of iron to tissues.\nThe bioavailability of iron in meals consumed in countries with a Western-\ntype diet has been measured by using different methods. Numerous single-\nmeal studies have shown absorption of non-haem iron ranging from 5% to\n40% (59, 98, 99). Attempts have also been made to estimate the bioavailabil-\nity of dietary",

Alternatives such\nas home fortiﬁcation of weaning foods should also be considered.\n• Critically analyse the effectiveness of iron compounds used for\nfortiﬁcation.\n• Study models for improving iron supplementation—from the distribution\nof iron tablets to increasing the motivation of individuals to take iron sup-\nplements, especially during pregnancy.\nReferences\n1.

Vitamin B12 is the largest of the B\ncomplex vitamins, with a relative molecular mass of over 1000. It consists of\na corrin ring made up of four pyrroles with cobalt at the centre of the ring\n(1, 2).\nThere are several vitamin B\n12-dependent enzymes in bacteria and algae, but\nno species of plants have the enzymes necessary for vitamin B12 synthesis. This\nfact has signiﬁcant implications for the dietary sources and availability of\nvitamin B\n12. In mammalian cells, there are only two vitamin B 12-dependent\nenzymes (3). One of these enzymes, methionine synthase, uses the chemical\nform of the vitamin which has a methyl group attached to the cobalt\nand is called methylcobalamin (see Chapter 15, Figure 15.2). The other\nenzyme, methylmalonyl coenzyme (CoA) mutase, uses a form of vitamin B\nthat has a 5 ¢-adeoxyadenosyl moiety attached to the cobalt and is called 5 ¢-\ndeoxyadenosylcobalamin, or coenzyme B 12. In nature, there are two other\nforms of vitamin B12: hydroxycobalamin and aquacobalamin, where hydroxyl\nand water groups, respectively, are attached to the cobalt. The synthetic form\nof vitamin B\n12 found in supplements and fortiﬁed foods is cyanocobalamin,\nwhich has cyanide attached to the cobalt. These three forms of vitamin B12 are\nenzymatically activated to the methyl- or deoxyadenosylcobalamins in all\nmammalian cells.\n14.2 Dietary sources and availability\nMost microorganisms, including bacteria and algae, synthesize vitamin B 12,\nand they constitute the only source of the vitamin ( 4).

Milk from cows and humans contains binders with very high afﬁn-\nity for vitamin B\n12, though whether they hinder or promote intestinal absorp-\ntion is not entirely clear. Omnivores and carnivores, including humans, derive\ndietary vitamin B\n12 almost exclusively from animal tissues or products (i.e.\nmilk, butter, cheese, eggs, meat, poultry). It appears that the vitamin B 12\nrequired by humans is not derived from microﬂora in any appreciable quan-\ntities, although vegetable fermentation preparations have been reported as\nbeing possible sources of vitamin B\n12 (6).\n14.3 Absorption\nThe absorption of vitamin B 12 in humans is complex ( 1, 2). Vitamin B 12 in\nfood is bound to proteins and is only released by the action of a high\nconcentration of hydrochloric acid present in the stomach. This process\nresults in the free form of the vitamin, which is immediately bound to a\nmixture of glycoproteins secreted by the stomach and salivary glands. These\nglycoproteins, called R-binders (or haptocorrins), protect vitamin B\n12 from\nchemical denaturation in the stomach. The stomach’s parietal cells, which\nsecrete hydrochloric acid, also secrete a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor.\nIntrinsic factor binds vitamin B\n12 and ultimately enables its active absorption.\nAlthough the formation of the vitamin B 12–intrinsic factor complex was ini-\ntially thought to happen in the stomach, it is now clear that this is not the\ncase. At an acidic pH, the afﬁnity of the intrinsic factor for vitamin B\n12 is low\nwhereas its afﬁnity for the R-binders is high. When the contents of the\nstomach enter the duodenum, the R-binders become partly digested by the\npancreatic proteases, which in turn causes them to release their vitamin B\n12.\nBecause the pH in the duodenum is more neutral than that in the",

This is not true of lacto-ovo vegetarians, who consume the vitamin in\neggs, milk, and other dairy products.\n14.4.2 Pernicious anaemia\nMalabsorption of vitamin B12 can occur at several points during digestion ( 1,\n4). By far the most important condition resulting in vitamin B 12 malabsorp-\ntion is the autoimmune disease called pernicious anaemia (PA). In most cases\nof PA, antibodies are produced against the parietal cells causing them to\natrophy, and lose their ability to produce intrinsic factor and secrete\nhydrochloric acid. In some forms of PA, the parietal cells remain intact but\nautoantibodies are produced against the intrinsic factor itself and attach to it,\nthus preventing it from binding vitamin B\n12. In another less common form of\nPA, the antibodies allow vitamin B12 to bind to the intrinsic factor but prevent\nthe absorption of the intrinsic factor–vitamin B 12 complex by the ileal recep-\ntors. As is the case with most autoimmune diseases, the incidence of PA\nincreases markedly with age. In most ethnic groups, it is virtually unknown\nto occur before the age of 50, with a progressive rise in incidence thereafter\n(4). However, African American populations are known to have an earlier age\nof presentation ( 4). In addition to causing malabsorption of dietary vitamin\nB\n12, PA also results in an inability to reabsorb the vitamin B12 which is secreted\nin the bile. Biliary secretion of vitamin B 12 is estimated to be between 0.3 and\n0.5mg/day. Interruption of this so-called enterohepatic circulation of vitamin\nB12 causes the body to go into a signiﬁcant negative balance for the vitamin.\nAlthough the body typically has sufﬁcient vitamin B12 stores to last 3–5 years,\nonce PA has been established, the lack of absorption of new vitamin B 12 is\ncompounded by the loss of the vitamin because of negative balance.

Atrophic gas-\ntritis does not prevent the reabsorption of biliary vitamin B 12 and therefore\ndoes not result in the negative balance seen in individuals with PA. Nonethe-\nless, it is agreed that with time, a reduction in the amount of vitamin B\nabsorbed from the diet will eventually deplete vitamin B 12 stores, resulting in\novert deﬁciency.\nWhen considering recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) for vitamin B 12\nfor the elderly, it is important to take into account the absorption of vitamin\nB\n12 from sources such as fortiﬁed foods or supplements as compared with\ndietary vitamin B12. In the latter instances, it is clear that absorption of intakes\nof less than 1.5–2.0 mg/day is complete—that is, for daily intakes of less than\n1.5–2.0 mg of free vitamin B 12, the intrinsic factor-mediated system absorbs\nthat entire amount. It is probable that this is also true of vitamin B 12 in forti-\nﬁed foods, although this has not been speciﬁcally examined. However,\nabsorption of food-bound vitamin B\n12 has been reported to vary from 9% to\n60% depending on the study and the source of the vitamin, which is perhaps\nrelated to its incomplete release from food ( 8). This has led many to estimate\nabsorption as being up to 50% to correct for the bioavailability of vitamin B\nfrom food.\n14.5 Vitamin B 12 interaction with folate or folic acid\nOne of the vitamin B 12-dependent enzymes, methionine synthase, functions\nin one of the two folate cycles, namely, the methylation cycle (see Chapter\n15). This cycle is necessary to maintain availability of the methyl donor,\nS-adenosylmethionine. Interruption of the cycle reduces the level of S-adeno-\nsylmethionine.

Clinical symptoms of PA, therefore, include\nneuropathy, anaemia, or both.

There\nis a wide difference in the vitamin B\n12 values reported in human milk because\nof differences in methodology. The previous FAO/WHO Expert Consulta-\ntion (11) based their recommendations on milk vitamin B\n12 values of normal\nwomen of about 0.4 mg/l.

Although daily intakes ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 mg/day have been\nfound to prevent deﬁciency ( 18, 19), these intakes are totally inadequate for\nlong-term health.

On the basis of fetal liver content from\npostmortem samples ( 21–23), there is further evidence that the fetus\naccumulates, on average, 0.1–0.2 mg/day of vitamin B 12 during pregnancies\nof women with diets which provide adequate levels of vitamin B 12. It has\nbeen reported that children born to vegetarians or other women with a\nlow vitamin B\n12 intake subsequently develop signs of clinical vitamin B 12\ndeﬁciency such as neuropathy ( 13). Therefore, in order to derive an EAR\nfor pregnant women, 0.2 mg/day of vitamin B 12 was added to the EAR for\nadults, to give an EAR of 2.2 mg/day and a RNI of 2.6 mg/day during\npregnancy.\n14.7 .5 Lactating women\nIt is estimated that 0.4 mg/day of vitamin B 12 is found in the human milk of\nwomen with adequate vitamin B12 status (8).

It is generally agreed that in some communities the\nonly source of vitamin B12 is from contamination of food by microorganisms.\nWhen vegans move to countries where standards of hygiene are more strin-\ngent, there is good evidence that risk of vitamin B\n12 deﬁciency increases in\nadults and, particularly, in children born to and breastfed by women who are\nstrict vegans.\nAs standards of hygiene improve in developing countries, there is a concern\nthat the prevalence of vitamin B\n12 deﬁciency might increase. This should be\nascertained by estimating plasma vitamin B12 levels, preferably in conjunction\nwith plasma MMA levels in representative adult populations and in infants.\nFurther research needs include the following:\n• ascertaining the contribution that fermented vegetable foods make to the\nvitamin B\n12 status of vegan communities;\n• investigating the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in developing countries to\ndetermine its extent in exacerbating vitamin B\n12 deﬁciency.\nReferences\n1.

In their reduced form cellular folates\nfunction conjugated to a polyglutamate chain. These folates are a mixture of\nunsubstituted polyglutamyl tetrahydrofolates and various substituted one-\ncarbon forms of tetrahydrofolate (e.g. 10-formyl-, 5,10-methylene-, and\n5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate) (Figure 15.1). The reduced forms of the vitamin,\nparticularly the unsubstituted dihydro and tetrahydro forms, are unstable\nchemically. They are easily split between the C-9 and N-10 bond to yield a\nsubstituted pteridine and p-aminobenzoylglutamate, which have no biologic\nactivity (2). Substituting a carbon group at N-5 or N-10 decreases the ten-\ndency of the molecule to split; however, the substituted forms are also sus-\nceptible to oxidative chemical rearrangements and, consequently, loss of\nactivity (2). The folates found in food consist of a mixture of reduced folate\npolyglutamates.\nThe chemical lability of all naturally-occurring folates results in a signiﬁ-\ncant loss of biochemical activity during harvesting, storage, processing, and\npreparation. Half or even three quarters of initial folate activity may be lost\nduring these processes. Although natural folates rapidly lose activity in foods\nover periods of days or weeks, the synthetic form of this vitamin, folic acid,\n(e.g. in fortiﬁed foods) is almost completely stable for months or even years\n(2). In this form, the pteridine (2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine) ring is not\nreduced (Figure 15.1), rendering it very resistant to chemical oxidation.\nHowever, folic acid is reduced in cells by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase\nto the dihydro and tetrahydro forms (Figure 15.2).

The primary form of folate entering human circulation from the\nintestinal cells is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate monoglutamate. This process is,\nhowever, limited in capacity. If enough folic acid is given orally, unaltered folic\nacid appears in the circulation ( 3), is taken up by cells, and is reduced by\ndihydrofolate reductase to tetrahydrofolate.\nThe bioavailability of natural folates is affected by the removal of the\npolyglutamate chain by the intestinal conjugase. This process is apparently\nnot complete ( 4), thereby reducing the bioavailability of natural folates by\nas much as 25–50%. In contrast, synthetic folic acid appears to be highly\nbioavailable—85% or greater ( 4, 5). The low bioavailability and, more impor-\ntantly, the poor chemical stability of the natural folates have a profound inﬂu-\nence on the development of nutrient recommendations. This is particularly\ntrue if some of the dietary intake is as the more stable and bioavailable syn-\nthetic form, folic acid. Fortiﬁcation of foods such as breakfast cereals and\nﬂour can add signiﬁcant amounts of folic acid to the diet.\nFunctional folates have one-carbon groups derived from several metabolic\nprecursors (e.g. serine, N-formino-l-glutamate, and folate). With 10-formyl-\ntetrahydrofolate, the formyl group is incorporated sequentially into C-2 and\nC-8 of the purine ring during its biosynthesis. Similarly, the conversion of\ndeoxyuridylate (a precursor to RNA) into thymidylate (a precursor to DNA)\nis catalysed by thymidylate synthase, which requires 5,10-methylenetetrahy-\ndrofolate. Thus, folate in its reduced and polyglutamylated forms is essential\nfor the DNA biosynthesis cycle shown in Figure 15.2.\nAlternatively, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate can be channelled to the\nmethylation cycle (Figure 15.2) ( 1).",

This cycle has two functions. It ensures\nthat the cell always has an adequate supply of S-adenosylmethionine, an acti-\nvated form of methionine which acts as a methyl donor to a wide range of\nmethyltransferases. The methyltransferases methylate a wide range of sub-\nstrates including lipids, hormones, DNA, and proteins. One particularly\nimportant methylation is that of myelin basic protein, which acts as insula-\ntion for nerve cells. When the methylation cycle is interrupted, as it is during\nvitamin B\n12 deﬁciency (see Chapter 14), one of the clinical consequences is the\ndemyelination of nerve cells resulting in a neuropathy which leads to ataxia,\nparalysis, and, if untreated, ultimately death. Other important methyltrans-\nferase enzymes down-regulate DNA and suppress cell division ( 1).\nIn the liver, the methylation cycle also serves to degrade methionine.\nMethionine is an essential amino acid in humans and is present in the diet of\npeople in developed countries at about 60% over that required for protein\nP289-302 3/12/05 17:10 Page 292",

The excess methionine is degraded via the methyla-\ntion cycle to homocysteine, which can either be catabolized to sulfate and\npyruvate (with the latter being used for energy) or remethylated to methion-\nine. All cells including the liver metabolize methionine to homocysteine as\npart of the methylation cycle. This cycle results in converting methionine to\nS-adenosylmethionine, which is used as a methyl donor for the numerous\nmethyltransferences that exist in all cells. This cycle effectively consumes\nmethyl (-CH\n3) groups and these must be replenished if the cycle is to main-\ntain an adequate concentration of S-adenosylmethionine, and thus the methy-\nlation reactions necessary for cell metabolism and survival. These methyl\ngroups are added to the cycle as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which the enzyme\nmethionine synthase uses to remethylate homocysteine back to methionine\nand thus to S-adenosylmethionine (Figure 15.2).\nThe DNA and methylation cycles both regenerate tetrahydrofolate.\nHowever, there is a considerable amount of catabolism of folate (6) and a small\nloss of folate via excretion from the urine, skin, and bile. Thus, there is a need\nto replenish the body’s folate content by uptake from the diet. If there is inad-\nequate dietary folate, the activity of both the DNA and the methylation cycles\nwill be reduced.

The most obvious expression of the decrease\nin the methylation cycle is an elevation in plasma homocysteine.

Pre-\nviously it was believed that a rise in plasma homocysteine was nothing more\nthan a biochemical marker of possible folate deﬁciency. However, there is\nincreasing evidence that elevations in plasma homocysteine are implicated in\nthe etiology of cardiovascular disease ( 7). Moreover, this moderate elevation\nof plasma homocysteine occurs in subjects with a folate status previously con-\nsidered adequate (8).\nInterruption of the methylation cycle resulting from impaired folate status\nor decreased vitamin B\n12 or vitamin B6 status may have serious long-term risks.\n15.

If untreated,\nthis leads to ataxia, paralysis, and ultimately death (see also Chapter 14). Such\nneuropathy is not usually associated with folate deﬁciency but is seen if folate\ndeﬁciency is very severe and prolonged ( 9). The explanation for this obser-\nvation may lie in the well-established ability of nerve tissue to concentrate\nfolate to a level of about ﬁve times that in the plasma. This may ensure that\nnerve tissue has an adequate level of folate when folate being provided to the\nrapidly dividing cells of the marrow has been severely compromised for a pro-\nlonged period. The resultant anaemia will thus inevitably present clinically\nearlier than the neuropathy.\n15.2 Populations at risk for folate deficiency\nNutritional deﬁciency of folate is common in people consuming a limited diet\n(10). This can be exacerbated by malabsorption conditions, including coeliac\ndisease and tropical sprue. Pregnant women are at risk for folate deﬁciency\nbecause pregnancy signiﬁcantly increases the folate requirement, especially\nduring periods of rapid fetal growth (i.e. in the second and third trimester)\n(6). During lactation, losses of folate in milk also increase the folate\nrequirement.\nDuring pregnancy, there is an increased risk of fetal neural tube defects\n(NTDs), with risk increasing 10-fold as folate status goes from adequate to\npoor (11). Between days 21 and 27 post-conception, the neural plate closes to\nform what will eventually be the spinal cord and cranium. Spina biﬁda,\nanencephaly, and other similar conditions are collectively called NTDs. They\nresult from improper closure of the spinal cord and cranium, respectively, and\nare the most common congenital abnormalities associated with folate\ndeﬁciency ( 12).\n15.3 Dietary sources of folate\nAlthough folate is found in a wide variety of foods, it is present in a relatively\nlow density (10) except in",

In addition, it was suggested that\nadequate folate status is reﬂected in a red cell folate level of greater than 150\nmg/l. Of less relevance was a liver folate level of greater than 7.5 mg/g, because\nsuch values only occur in rare circumstances. A normal N-formino-l-gluta-\nmate test was also cited as evidence of sufﬁciency, but this test has since been\nlargely discredited and abandoned as not having any useful function (10). Red\ncell folate, however, continues to be used as an important index of folate status\n(14). Plasma folate is also used but is subject to greater ﬂuctuation. Indicators\nof haematologic status such as raised mean corpuscular volume, hyperseg-\nmentation of neutrophils, and, eventually, the ﬁrst stages of anaemia also\nremain important indicators of reduced folate status ( 15).\nMore recently, the biomarker plasma homocysteine has been identiﬁed as\na very sensitive indicator of folate status and must be added to the list of pos-\nsible indicators of folate adequacy ( 16). This applies not only to the deﬁcient\nrange of red blood cell folate but also to normal and even above-normal levels\nof red cell folate ( 14).

    "text": "15.5 Differences in bioavailability of folic acid and\nfood folate: implications for the recommended intakes\nThe RNIs suggested for groups in Table 15.1 assume that food folate is the\nsole source of dietary folate because most societies in developing countries\nconsume folate from naturally-occurring sources. As discussed in the intro-\nduction (section 15.1), natural folates are found in a conjugated form in food,\nwhich reduces their bioavailability by perhaps as much as 50% ( 4). In addi-\ntion, natural folates are much less stable. If chemically pure folic acid (pteroyl-\nmonoglutamate) is used to provide part of the RNI, by way of fortiﬁcation\nor supplementation, the total dietary folate, which contains conjugated forms\n(pteroylpolyglutamates), could be reduced by an appropriate amount.\nThe recommended daily intake of naturally-occurring mixed forms of folate\nin the diet for adults is 400 mg/day. If for example 100mg is consumed as pure\nfolic acid, on the basis of the assumption that, on average, the conjugated folate\nin natural foods is only half as available as synthetic folic acid this would be\nconsidered to be equivalent to 200 mg of dietary mixed folate. Hence, only an\nadditional 200 mg of dietary folate would be needed to meet the adult RNI.\nThe Consultation agreed with the following ﬁndings of the Food and\nNutrition Board of the United States NAS ( 22):\nSince folic acid taken with food is 85% bioavailable but food folate is\nonly about 50% bioavailable, folic acid taken with food is 85/50 (i.e. 1.7)\ntimes more available. Thus, if a mixture of synthetic folic acid plus food\nfolate has been fed, dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) are calculated as\nfollows to determine the EAR:\nmg of DFE provided = [mg of food folate + (1.7 ¥m g of synthetic folic\nacid)].\nTo be comparable to food folate, only half as much folic acid is needed if\ntaken on an empty stomach, i.e. 1mg of DFE = 1mg of food folate = 0.5mg",

Because of the poorer bioavail-\nability and stability of food folate, a diet based on food folate will not be\noptimum in the prevention of NTDs. One study determined that risk of NTD\nis 10-fold higher in people with poor folate status than in those with high\nnormal folate status, as reﬂected by a red cell folate level greater than 400 mg/l\n(11). A further study suggests that an extra 200mg/day or possibly 100mg/day,\nif taken habitually in fortiﬁed food, would prevent most, if not all, folate-\npreventable NTDs ( 26). Ideally, an extra 400 mg/day should be provided\nbecause this is the amount used in various intervention trials (12) and that can\nbe achieved by supplementation. This amount could not be introduced by\nway of fortiﬁcation because exposure to high intakes of folic acid by people\nconsuming a large intake of ﬂour would run the risk of preventing the diag-\nnosis of pernicious anaemia in the elderly. It is likely that depending on the\nstaple chosen it would be possible to increase intake in most women by 100\nmg/day without exposing other groups to an amount that might mask diseases\nsuch as pernicious anaemia. It is suggested that this amount, although not\noptimal, will prevent most NTDs.\n15.6.2 Cardiovascular disease\nPlasma homocysteine concentration, if only moderately elevated, is an\nindependent risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( 7, 8, 17) and stroke ( 18).\nIncreased risk has been associated with values higher than 11mmol/l (8), which\nis well within what is generally considered to be the normal range (5–15\nmmol/l) of plasma homocysteine levels ( 27).

However, this clearly does not apply to\nfolic acid given in supplements or fortiﬁed foods. The main concern with for-\ntiﬁcation of high levels of folic acid is the masking of the diagnosis of perni-\ncious anaemia, because high levels of folic acid correct the anaemia, allowing\nthe neuropathy to progress undiagnosed to a point where it may become irre-\nversible, even upon treatment with vitamin B\n12 (1, 29). Consumption of\nlarge amounts of folic acid might also pose other less well-deﬁned risks.\nCertainly, consumption of milligram amounts of folic acid would be unde-\nsirable except in cases of pregnant women with a history of children with\nNTD. Savage and Lindenbaum ( 30) suggest that even at levels of the RNI\ngiven here, there is a decreased opportunity to diagnose pernicious anaemia\nin subjects.\nThe United States NAS ( 22), after reviewing the literature, has suggested\nan upper level of 1000 mg. Thus, 400 mg/day of folic acid, in addition to\ndietary folate, would seem safe. There is probably no great risk of toxicity\nat a range of intakes between 400 and 1000 mg of folic acid per day, with\nthe exception of some increased difﬁculty in diagnosing pernicious\nanaemia.\n15.8 Recommendations for future research\nThere are many areas for future research, including:\n• Folate status may be related to birth weight.

Iodine\n16.1 Role of iodine in human metabolic processes\nAt present, the only physiological role known for iodine in the human body\nis in the synthesis of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Therefore, the\ndietary requirement of iodine is determined by normal thyroxine (T\n4) pro-\nduction by the thyroid gland without stressing the thyroid iodide trapping\nmechanism or raising thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.\nIodine from the diet is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\nDietary iodine is converted into the iodide ion before it is absorbed. The\niodide ion is 100% bioavailable and absorbed totally from food and water.\nThis is, however, not true for iodine within thyroid hormones ingested for\ntherapeutic purposes.\nIodine enters the circulation as plasma inorganic iodide, which is cleared\nfrom the circulation by the thyroid and kidney. The iodide is used by the\nthyroid gland for synthesis of thyroid hormones, and the kidney excretes\nexcess iodine with urine. The excretion of iodine in the urine is a good\nmeasure of iodine intake. In a normal population with no evidence of clini-\ncal iodine deﬁciency either in the form of endemic goitre or endemic cre-\ntinism, urinary iodine excretion reﬂects the average daily iodine requirement.\nTherefore, for determining the iodine requirements and the iodine intake, the\nimportant indexes are serum T\n4 and TSH levels (exploring thyroid status) and\nurinary iodine excretion (exploring iodine intake). A simpliﬁed diagram of\nthe metabolic circuit of iodine is given in Figure 16.1.\nAll biological actions of iodide are attributed to the thyroid hormones. The\nmajor thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland is T\n4. T4 in circulation\nis taken up by the cells and is de-iodinated by the enzyme 5¢-monodeiodinase\nin the cytoplasm to convert it into triiodothyronine (T 3), the active form of\nthyroid hormone. T3 traverses to the nucleus and binds to the nuclear recep-\ntor.

If iodine deﬁciency exists during this period and results in\nthyroid hormone deﬁciency, the consequence is derangement in the develop-\nment of the brain and central nervous system.

These include carbohydrate, fat, protein,\nvitamin, and mineral metabolism.

The iodine present in the upper crust of the earth is leached by\nglaciation and repeated ﬂooding, and is carried to the sea. Seawater is, there-\nfore, a rich source of iodine ( 6).

Thus, a population consum-\ning seaweed and reef ﬁsh will have a high intake of iodine, as is the case in\nJapan. Iodine intakes by the Japanese are typically in the range of 2–3mg/day\n(6). In several areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe, iodine\nintake varies from 20 to 80mg/day.

These amounts are proposed to allow normal T 4 produc-\ntion without stressing the thyroid iodide trapping mechanism or raising TSH\nlevels.\n16.4.1 Infants\nThe recommendation of 40 mg/day for infants aged 0–6 months (or 8\nmg/kg/day, 7mg/100kcal, or 50 mg/l milk) is probably based on the observa-\ntion reported in the late 1960s that the iodine content of human milk was\napproximately 50 mg/l and the assumption that nutrition of the human-milk-\nfed infant growing at a satisfactory rate represents an adequate level of\nnutrient intake ( 8, 9). However, recent data indicate that the iodine content\nof human milk varies markedly as a function of the iodine intake of the pop-\nulation (10). For example, it ranges from 20 to 330mg/l in Europe and from 30\nto 490mg/l in the United States (8, 10, 11). It is as low as 12mg/l in populations\nexperiencing severe iodine deﬁciency (8, 10). On this basis, an average human-\nmilk intake of 750ml/day would give an intake of iodine of about 60 mg/day\nin Europe and 120mg/day in the United States. The upper United States value\n(490mg/l) would provide 368 mg/day or 68 mg/kg/day for a 5-kg infant.\nPositive iodine balance in the young infant, which is required for increas-\ning the iodine stores of the thyroid, is achieved only when the iodine intake\nis at least 15 mg/kg/day in term infants and 30 mg/kg/day in pre-term infants\n(12).

A study by Tovar and colleagues ( 21) correlating 24-hour thyroid\nradioiodine uptake and urinary iodine excretion in 9–13-year-old school-\nchildren in rural Mexico suggested that an iodine intake in excess of 60mg/day\nis associated with a 24-hour thyroidal radioiodine uptake below 30%.

An intake of 60–100 mg/day for a child\nof 1–10 years thus seems appropriate. These requirements are based on the\nbody weight of Mexican children who participated in this study.

Once a median urinary iodine excretion of about\n100mg/l is reached, the ratio of thyroid size to body size remains fairly con-\nstant. Moulopoulos et al. (27) reported that a urinary iodine excretion between\n151 and 200 mg/g creatinine (1.18–1.57 mmol/g creatinine), corresponding to a\nconcentration of about 200 mg/l (1.57 mmol/l), correlated with the lowest\nvalues for serum TSH in a non-goitrous population. Similarly, recent data\nfrom Australia show that the lowest serum TSH and thyroglobulin values\nwere associated with urine containing 200–300 mg iodine/g creatinine\n(1.57–2.36 mmol iodine/g creatinine) ( 28).\nOther investigations followed serum TSH levels in adult subjects without\nthyroid glands who were given graded doses of T\n4 and found that an average\ndaily dose of 100 mg T4 would require at least 65 mg of iodine to be used with\nmaximal efﬁciency by the thyroid in order to establish euthyroidism. In prac-\ntice, such maximal efﬁciency is never obtained and therefore considerably\nmore iodine is necessary. Data from controlled observations associated a low\nurinary iodine concentration with a high goitre prevalence, high radioiodine\nuptake, and low thyroidal organic iodine content ( 12).

For example, in Belgium, where the iodine intake is estimated to\nbe 50–70 mg/day (30), thyroid function during pregnancy is characterized by\na progressive decrease in the serum concentrations of free-thyroid hormones\nand an increase in serum TSH and thyroglobulin.

These data indicate that the iodine intake\nrequired to prevent the onset of subclinical hypothyroidism of mother and\nfetus during pregnancy, and thus to prevent the possible risk of brain damage\nof the fetus, is approximately 200 mg/day.\nOn the basis of the above considerations for the respective population\ngroups, the Expert Consultation concluded that the WHO/UNICEF/\nICCIDD recommendations for daily iodine intakes ( 14) were the best avail-\nable and saw no grounds for altering them at the present time. The current\nintake recommendations for iodine are summarized in Table 16.4.\n16.5 Upper limits\nWhile a physiological amount of iodine is required for insuring a normal\nthyroid function, a large excess of iodine can be harmful to the thyroid by\ninhibiting the process of synthesis and release of thyroid hormones (Wolff-\nChaikoff effect) ( 33). The threshold upper limit of iodine intake (the intake\nbeyond which thyroid function is inhibited) is not easy to deﬁne because it\nis affected by the level of iodine intake before exposure to iodine excess.\nIndeed, long-standing moderate iodine deﬁciency is accompanied by an accel-\nerated trapping of iodide and by a decrease in the iodine stores within the\nthyroid ( 23). Under these conditions, the critical ratio between iodide and\ntotal iodine within the thyroid, which is the starting point of the Wolff-\nChaikoff effect, is more easily reached in conditions of insufﬁcient dietary\nsupply of iodine than under normal conditions.

Consequently,\nthe upper limit of iodine intake will depend on both basal status of iodine\nintake and age.\n16.5.1 Iodine intake in areas of moderate iodine deficiency\nIn a study in Belgium, iodine overload of mothers (caused by use of cuta-\nneous povidone iodine for epidural anaesthesia or caesarean section) increased\nthe milk iodine concentration of women and increased urinary iodine excre-\ntion in their term newborn infants (mean weight about 3kg) ( 35). In the\nabsence of iodine overload, the mean iodine content of breast milk was 9mg/dl\n(0.63mmol/l) and the urinary iodine of the infant at 5 days of life was 12mg/dl\n(0.94mmol/l). After the use of povidone iodine in the mother for epidural\nanaesthesia or for caesarean section, the mean milk iodine concentrations were\n18 and 128 mg/dl, and were associated with average infant urinary iodine\nexcretion levels of 280 and 1840 mg/l (2.20–14.48 mmol/l), respectively ( 35).\nBased on an intake of some 6.5dl of breast milk per day, the estimated average\niodine intakes in the babies of iodine overload mothers were 117 and 832\nmg/day, or 39 and 277 mg/kg/day, respectively.

The upper limit probably should be one that\nprovides a daily iodine intake of no more than 100mg/kg. For this limit—with\nthe assumption that the total intake is from infant formula—and with a daily\nmilk intake of 150ml/kg (100kcal/kg), the upper limit of the iodine content\nof infant formula would be about 65 mg/dl. The current suggested upper limit\nof iodine in infant formula of 75 mg/100kcal (89 mg/500kJ or 50 mg/dl), there-\nfore, seems reasonable.\n16.5.3 Excess iodine intake\nExcess iodine intake in healthy adults in iodine-replete areas is difﬁcult to\ndeﬁne. Many people are regularly exposed to huge amounts of iodine—in the\nrange 10–200mg/day—without apparent adverse effects. Common sources\nare medicines (e.g. amiodarone contains 75mg iodine per 200-mg capsule),\nfoods (particularly dairy products), kelp (eaten in large amounts in Japan),\nand iodine-containing dyes (for radiologic procedures). Occasionally, each of\nthese may have signiﬁcant thyroid effects, but generally, they are tolerated\nwithout difﬁculty. Braverman et al. (41) showed that people without evidence\nof underlying thyroid disease almost always remain euthyroid in the face\nof large amounts of excess iodine and escape the acute inhibitory effects of\nexcess intrathyroidal iodide on the organiﬁcation (i.e. attachment of\noxidized iodine species to tyrosil residues in the thyroid gland for the syn-\nthesis of thyroid hormones) of iodide and on subsequent hormone synthesis\n(escape from, or adaptation to, the acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect). This adapta-\ntion most likely involves a decrease in thyroid iodide trapping, perhaps cor-\nresponding to a decrease in the thyroid sodium-iodide transporter recently\ncloned (42).\nThis tolerance to huge doses of iodine in healthy iodine-replete adults is\nthe reason why WHO stated in 1994 that, “Daily iodine intakes of up to\n1mg, i.e. 1000 mg",

In addition, it has to be considered that iodine excess can induce\nhypothyroidism in patients affected by thyroiditis (44) and can induce hyper-\nthyroidism in cases of a sudden and excessive increment of iodine supply in\npatients with autonomous thyroid nodules ( 3, 4, 45 ). Finally, iodine excess\ncan trigger thyroid autoimmunity in genetically susceptible animals and indi-\nviduals and may modify the pattern of thyroid cancer by increasing the ratio\nof papillary–follicular thyroid cancers ( 46).\nIn conclusion, it clearly appears that the beneﬁts of correcting iodine deﬁ-\nciency far outweigh the risks of iodine supplementation ( 46, 47).\nP303-317 3/12/05 17:11 Page 314",

Changes in these patterns are\ndependent on such things as agricultural practices and climatic, ecologic, cul-\ntural, and socioeconomic factors, which in turn, determine which foods are\navailable. At present, virtually all dietary patterns show that the nutritional\nneeds of population groups are adequately satisﬁed or even exceeded. This is\ntrue except where socioeconomic conditions limit the capacity to produce and\npurchase food or aberrant cultural practices restrict the choice of foods. It is\nthought that if people have access to a sufﬁcient quantity and variety of foods,\nthey will meet, in large part, their nutritional needs. However, for certain\ngroups of people because of economic restrictions, levels of certain micronu-\ntrients may not be met from food alone. Thus, micronutrient adequacy must\nbe included in evaluating the nutritive value of diets alongside energy and\nprotein adequacy.\nA healthful diet can be attained through the intake of multiple combina-\ntions of a variety of foods. Given this, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne the ranges of\nintake for a speciﬁc food, which should be included in a given combination\nwith other foods to comply with nutritional adequacy. In practice, the set of\nfood combinations which provide nutritional adequacy are limited by the\nlevel of food production sustainable in a given ecological setting. In addition,\nthere are economic constraints that limit food supply at the household level.\nThe development of food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) ( 1) recognizes\nthis and focuses on how a combination of foods can meet nutrient require-\nments rather than on how each speciﬁc nutrient is provided in adequate\namounts.\nThe ﬁrst step in the process of setting dietary guidelines is deﬁning the sig-\nniﬁcant diet-related public health problems in a community. Once these are\ndeﬁned, the adequacy of the diet is evaluated by comparing the information\navailable on dietary intake with the established recommended nutrient intakes\n(RNIs).

Dietary guidelines represent the\npractical way to reach the nutritional goals for a given population. They take\ninto account customary dietary patterns and indicate what aspects of each\nshould be modiﬁed. They consider the ecological setting in which the popu-\nlation lives, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural factors that affect nutri-\ntional adequacy.\nThe alternative approach to deﬁning nutritional adequacy of diets relies\non the biochemical and physiological basis of human nutritional requirements\nin health and disease. The quantitative deﬁnition of nutrient needs and its\nexpression as RNIs have been important instruments of food and nutrition\npolicy in many countries and have focused the attention of international\nbodies on this critical issue. This nutrient-based approach has served many\npurposes but has not always fostered the establishment of nutritional and\ndietary priorities consistent with the broad public health priorities at the\nnational and international levels. It has permitted a more precise deﬁnition of\nrequirements for essential nutrients but unfortunately has often been too nar-\nrowly focused, concentrating on the precise nutrient requirement amount,\nand not on solving the nutritional problems of the world.\nIn contrast to RNIs, FBDGs are based on the fact that people eat food, not\nnutrients. Deﬁning nutrient intakes alone is only part of the task of dealing\nwith nutritional adequacy. As will be illustrated in this chapter, the notion of\nnutrient density is helpful for deﬁning FBDGs and evaluating the adequacy\nof diets. However, unlike RNIs, FBDGs can be used to educate the public\nthrough the mass media and provide a practical guide to selecting foods by\ndeﬁning dietary adequacy ( 1).\nAdvice for a healthful diet should provide both a quantitative and\nqualitative description of the diet for it to be understood by individuals,\nwho should be given information on both size and number of servings\nper day.

Most population groups who\nare deﬁcient in micronutrients subsist largely on reﬁned cereal grain- or tuber-\nbased diets, which provide energy and protein (with an improper amino acid\nbalance) but insufﬁcient levels of critical micronutrients. There is a need for\na broadening of the food base and a diversiﬁcation of diets. Figures 17.1–17.4\nillustrate how addition of a variety of foods to four basic diets (i.e. a white\nrice-based diet; a corn-tortilla-based diet; a reﬁned couscous-based diet;\nand a potato-based diet) can increase the nutrient density of a cereal- or\ntuber-based diet. Adding reasonable amounts of these foods will add\nmicronutrient density to the staple diet and in doing so could reduce the\nprevalence of diseases resulting from a micronutrient deﬁciency across pop-\nulations groups.\nThe recent interest in the role of phytochemicals and antioxidants on\nhealth, and their presence in plant foods, lends further support to the recom-\nmendation for increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruit in the diet.\nThe need for dietary diversiﬁcation is supported by the knowledge of the\ninterrelationships of food components, which may enhance the nutritional\nvalue of foods and prevent undesirable imbalances which may limit the\nutilization of some nutrients.

The nutrients selected for\ndiscussion include those that are among the most difﬁcult to obtain in\ncereal- and tuber-based diets (i.e. diets based on rice, corn, wheat, potato\nor cassava). Moreover, nutrient deﬁciencies of vitamin A, iron, and zinc are\nwidespread.\n17.2.1 Vitamin A\nThe vitamin A content of most staple diets can be signiﬁcantly improved with\nthe addition of a relatively small portion of plant foods rich in carotenoids,\nthe precursors of vitamin A. For example, a typical portion of cooked carrots\n(50g) added to a daily diet, or 21g of carrots per 4.184MJ, provides 500 mg\nretinol equivalents, which is the recommended nutrient density for this\nvitamin. The biological activity of provitamin A varies among different plant\nsources; fruits and vegetables such as carrots, mango, papaya, and melon\ncontain large amounts of nutritionally active carotenoids ( 3, 4). Green leafy\nvegetables such as ivy gourd have been successfully used in Thailand as a\nsource of vitamin A, and carotenoid-rich red palm oil serves as an easily avail-\nable and excellent source of vitamin A in other countries. Consequently, a\nregular portion of these foods included in an individual’s diet may provide\n100% or more of the daily requirement for retinol equivalents (Figures\n17.1–17.4b). Vitamin A is also present in animal food sources in a highly\nbioavailable form. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of\nmeeting vitamin A needs by including animal foods in the diet. For example,\nproviding minor amounts of ﬁsh or chicken liver (20–25g) in the diet pro-\nvides more than the recommended vitamin A nutrient density for virtually all\npopulation groups.\n17.2.2 Vitamin C\nAn increased vitamin C intake can be achieved by including citrus fruit or\nother foods rich in as",

Because ascorbic acid is heat labile, minimal cooking (steaming or stir-\nfrying) is recommended to maximize the bioavailable nutrient. The signiﬁ-\ncance of consuming vitamin C with meals is discussed relative to iron\nabsorption below (see also Chapter 13).\n17.2.3 Folate\nFolate is now considered signiﬁcant not only for the prevention of macro-\ncytic anaemia, but also for normal fetal development. Recently, this vitamin\nwas implicated in the maintenance of cardiovascular health and cognitive\nfunction in the elderly. Staple diets consisting largely of cereal grains and\ntubers are very low in folate but can be improved by the addition of legumes\nor green leafy vegetables. For example, a regular portion of cooked lentils\n(95g) added to a rice-based diet can provide an amount of folate sufﬁcient to\nmeet the desirable nutrient density for this vitamin (Figure 17.1d). Other\nlegumes such as beans and peas are also good sources of this vitamin, but\nlarger portions are needed for folate sufﬁciency (100g beans and 170g peas).\nCluster bean and colacasia leaves are excellent folate sources used in the Indian\ndiet. Another good source of folate is chicken liver; only one portion (20–\n25g) is sufﬁcient to meet the desirable nutrient density for folate and vitamin\nA simultaneously. The best sources of folate are organ meats, green leafy veg-\netables, and Brussels sprouts. However, 50% or more of food folate is\ndestroyed during cooking. Prolonged heating in large volumes of water\nshould be avoided, and it is advisable to consume the water used in the\ncooking of vegetables.\n17.2.4 Iron and zinc\nMinerals such as iron and zinc are found in low amounts in cereal- and tuber-\nbased diets.

A recent FAO/International Life Sciences Insti-\ntute publication (5) proposed strategies to promote dietary diversiﬁcation as\npart of food-based approaches to preventing micronutrient malnutrition.\nThese strategies, which are listed below, have been further adapted or modi-\nﬁed by the present Expert Consultation:\n• Community or home vegetable and fruit gardens . Support for small-scale\nvegetable and fruit growing should lead to increased production and con-\nsumption of micronutrient-rich foods (e.g. legumes, green leafy vegetables,\nand fruits) at the household level.

In\naddition, the consumption of tea, coffee, chocolate, or herbal infusions should\nbe encouraged at times other than with meals (see Chapter 13).

It is possible for a single nutrient or group of micronutrients (the\nfortiﬁcant) to be added to the vehicle, which has been identiﬁed through a\nprocess in which all stakeholders have participated. This approach is accepted\nas sustainable under most conditions and is often cost effective on a large scale\nwhen successfully implemented. Both iron fortiﬁcation of wheat ﬂour and\niodine fortiﬁcation of salt are examples of fortiﬁcation strategies that have\nproduced excellent results ( 7).\nThere are at least three essential conditions which must be met in any for-\ntiﬁcation programme ( 7, 8): the fortiﬁcant should be effective, bioavailable,\nacceptable, and affordable; the selected food vehicle should be easily accessi-\nble and a speciﬁed amount of it should be regularly consumed in the local\ndiet; and detailed production instructions and monitoring procedures should\nbe in place and enforced by law.\nIron fortification\nFood fortiﬁcation with iron is recommended when dietary iron is in-\nsufﬁcient or the dietary iron is of poor bioavailability, which is the reality\nfor most people in the developing world and for vulnerable population groups\nin the developed world. Moreover, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency\nand anaemia in vegetarians and in populations of the developing world which\nrely on cereal or tuber foods is signiﬁcantly higher than in omnivorous\npopulations.\nIron is present in foods in two forms, as haem iron, which is derived\nfrom ﬂesh foods (meats and ﬁsh), and as non-haem iron, which is the\ninorganic form present in plant foods such as legumes, grains, nuts, and\nvegetables (9, 10). Haem iron is the more readily absorbed (20–30%) and its\nbioavailability is relatively unaffected by dietary factors.

Only foods of marine origin are naturally\nrich sources of iodine. Salt is a common food used by most people\nworldwide, and the establishment of a well-implemented permanent salt-\niodination programme has been proven to eradicate iodine deﬁciency\ndisorders. Universal salt iodination is the best way to virtually eliminate\niodine deﬁciency disorders ( 5).\nHowever, salt iodination is not simply a matter of legislating the manda-\ntory iodination of salt. It is important to determine the best fortiﬁcation tech-\nnique, coordinate the implementation at all salt production sites, establish\neffective monitoring and quality control programmes, and measure the iodine\nfortiﬁcation level periodically. The difﬁculties in implementing salt iodination\nprogrammes arise primarily when the salt industry is widely dispersed among\nmany small producers. The level of iodine fortiﬁcation usually lies between\n25 and 50mg/kg salt. The actual amount should be speciﬁed according to the\nlevel of salt intake and the magnitude of the deﬁcit at the country level,\nbecause iodine must be added within safe and effective ranges. Thus, it is very\nimportant to implement a monitoring plan to control the amount of iodine\nin the salt at the consumer’s table (11, 12). Additionally, United Nations agen-\ncies responsible for assisting governments in establishing iodination pro-\ngrammes should provide technical support for programme implementation,\nmonitoring, and evaluation to ensure sustainability.\nZinc fortification\nThe body depends on a regular zinc supply provided by the daily diet because\nstores are quite limited.

Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered to be\nan independent risk factor for heart disease; a higher intake of folic acid may\nalso beneﬁt the rest of the population because it may lower homocysteine\nlevels in adults (see Chapter 15). In addition, folate may improve the mental\ncondition of the elderly population ( 13, 14).\nAlthough the desirable folic acid density may be achieved through dietary\ndiversity, it requires the daily presence of organ meats, green leafy vegetables,\npulses, legumes, or nuts in the diet ( 15). Most population groups may not\neasily reach the appropriate level of folic acid consumption; therefore, folic\nacid fortiﬁcation has been recommended. The United States initiated manda-\ntory folic acid fortiﬁcation of cereal-grain products in January 1998.

Their primary purpose is to educate health-\ncare professionals and consumers about health promotion and disease pre-\nvention. In this way, priorities in establishing dietary guidelines can address\nthe relevant public health concerns whether they are related to dietary insuf-\nﬁciency or excess. In this context, meeting the nutritional needs of popula-\ntions takes its place as one of the components of food and nutrition policy\ngoals along with the priorities included in the FBDGs for improved health\nand nutrition for a given population.\nThe world nutrition and health situation demonstrates that the major\ncauses of death and disability have been traditionally related to malnutrition\nin developing countries and to the imbalance between energy intake and\nexpenditure (which lead to obesity and other chronic diseases—diabetes, car-\ndiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke) in industrialized countries.

    "text": "The Western Pacific Region has one of the largest and fastest growing older population in the world. There are more than 245 million people aged 65 years and older in the Western Pacific Region and this number is expected to double by 2050. Population ageing has significant societal implications, including an increase in burden of NCDs as well as a growing population of people with diverse functional abilities. Supporting healthy ageing requires a long-term, whole-of-society approach. Specifically, health system transformation is needed to accompany people throughout their life, placing a greater emphasis on preventative health and addressing the social determinants of health. Communities also need to be strengthened to provide integrated services and supports to older adults that are tailored to individual needs. Population ageing also offers many opportunities for individuals and society as a whole. People are living longer, enabling them to engage in a wider range of activities and interests that are meaningful to them across their lifetime. The growing older population is also better educated and more knowledgeable than ever before, enabling them to offer greater contributions to society. However, to fully realize these opportunities, a change in narrative is needed from one that views older adults as societal burdens to recognizing the many valuable contributions they can make to society when they are supported and encouraged to do so. The rapidly population ageing population in the Western Pacific Region has widespread implications for health, wellbeing, and the general organization of societies. It increases demand for primary health care and long-term care, requires a larger and better trained health workforce, increases the need for physical and social environments to be made more age-friendly, and calls for actions to tackle ageism. Turning challenges into opportunities by investing in healthy ageing through health promotion, prevention, quality healthcare, age-friendly policies and transformations is therefore paramount. It can yield significant benefits for individuals and society in general. Older adults contribute to society in a variety of ways including through paid and unpaid work, as caregivers for family members, and passing down knowledge and traditions to younger generations. They also contribute to the economy as employees, consumers, investors, and social service providers. The World Health Organization is committed to supporting Member States and ensuring positive impact on communities across the Western Pacific Region in fulfilling this vision of older people living longer and healthier lives for the benefit of all. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States, UN agencies and diverse stakeholders from various sectors to improve the health and well-being of older populations in the Region so that they thrive and contribute in society. WHO does this work in the Region through the Regional",

The World Health Organization is committed to supporting Member States and ensuring positive impact on communities across the Western Pacific Region in fulfilling this vision of older people living longer and healthier lives for the benefit of all. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States, UN agencies and diverse stakeholders from various sectors to improve the health and well-being of older populations in the Region so that they thrive and contribute in society. WHO does this work in the Region through the Regional Action Plan on Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific , which advocates for a whole-of-society transformation, beyond health systems. Adding years to life can offer individuals and society new opportunities, but only if society encourages and enables older people to remain healthy and to continue participating and thriving. Working with Member States, the Regional Action Plan outlines five objectives for achieving the vision of healthy ageing in the Western Pacific Region: Transform societies as a whole to promote healthy ageing. Transform health systems to address each individual’s lifelong health needs by providing necessary health and non-health services in a coordinated way. Provide community-based integrated care for older adults tailored to individual needs. Fostering technological and social innovation to promote healthy ageing. Strengthen monitoring and surveillance systems and research on older adults to inform programmes, services and policies. WHO continues to support countries to operationalize this Regional Action Plan, to provide tools, knowledge and information-sharing platforms, and to advocate to prevent and counteract negative stereotypes about ageing.

    "text": "Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risk to health. Air pollution leads people to be exposed to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections. WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants , with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. Both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution are responsible for about 7 million deaths globally per year; in the Western Pacific Region alone, around 2.2 million people die each year. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change. The Western Pacific Region bears the greatest share of deaths due to air pollution globally. Every 14 seconds a person dies as a result of air pollution in the Region. Children – especially those in low-income countries with fewer resources to mitigate the health impacts – are among the most at risk. Older people are also especially vulnerable to respiratory and other diseases caused by air pollution and aeroallergens. Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution. Under the For the Future vision for making the Western Pacific the healthiest and safest region, WHO supports countries in the Region to develop narratives and arguments about the relationship between climate change, environmental degradation and health, including air pollution, in order to advocate for action at the highest political level. WHO also monitors the health impacts air pollution and climate change on health; and provides technical support to Member States in the development of normative guidance, tools and provision of authoritative advice on health issues related to air pollution and its sources.

During the same period of time, the total alcohol per-capita consumption in the Region increased from 4.8 litres to 7.3 litres, surpassing the global average by almost 10%. The volume of alcohol consumed and patterns of consumption vary substantially between countries and areas. The greatest levels of alcohol consumption occur in high-income countries, with a slight and sustained decrease in alcohol consumption over the past decade. Over the last two decades, alcohol consumption has dramatically increased in low- and middle-income countries and areas. Consumption of alcohol is a preventable risk factor that can cause premature death and over 200 diseases including 7 types of cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cirrhosis of the liver and several infectious diseases. In addition to its risk to noncommunicable diseases, alcohol use has been identified as an important risk factor for different types of injury including road traffic injuries, drowning, fall and violence. Globally, an estimated 900 000 injury deaths in 2016 were attributable to alcohol, including around 41% of deaths due to road injuries, 17% due to self-harm and around 10% due to interpersonal violence. In the same year the rate of alcohol-attributable deaths in the Region was 24.3 per 100 000 people. To solve future problems associated with alcohol, we must take action now to discourage alcohol consumption in the first place. It is important to tackle the underlying causes of alcohol consumption, and in turn prevent alcohol-related health loss, including from injury and violence. This includes identifying and addressing the social and commercial determinants that contribute to alcohol-related harm and identifying synergies between alcohol control and other interventions, such as policies that regulate drink and drive. WHO in the Western Pacific supports countries in the dissemination and implementation of WHO’s technical guidance through the SAFER initiative , which outlines 5 evidence-based recommendations to preventing and reducing alcohol-related harms.

Microorganisms that develop AMR are sometimes referred to as “superbugs”. As a result, the medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread to others. AMR occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes. However, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials is accelerating this process. Antimicrobial resistance is a complex problem that affects all of society and is driven by many interconnected factors. Single, isolated interventions have limited impact. Coordinated action is required to minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. All countries need national action plans on AMR, and greater innovation and investment are required in research and development of new antimicrobial medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tools.

    "text": "Breastfeeding is the best way of providing young infants with the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. Virtually, all mothers can breastfeed, provided they have accurate information and the support of their family, the health care system and society at large. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years and beyond. WHO also recommends early and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in and kangaroo mother care, which significantly improve neonatal survival and reduce morbidity. In the Western Pacific, 15 Member States have adopted national legal measures aligned with the International Code of Marketing for Breastmilk Substitutes to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. WHO and UNICEF recommend that children initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life – meaning no other foods or liquids are provided, including water. Infants should be breastfed on demand – that is as often as the child wants, day and night. No bottles, teats or pacifiers should be used. From the age of 6 months, children should begin eating safe and adequate complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to two years of age or beyond. WHO actively promotes breastfeeding as the best source of nourishment for infants and young children, and is working to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months up to at least 50% by 2025. WHO provides guidance to Member States on eliminating exposure of the general public to marketing of breast-milk substitutes and the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children through implementing the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in the Western Pacific Region. In addition, WHO works with partners such as the International Labor Organization on maternity protection so that mothers can be with their infants to breastfeed, and with UNICEF on a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative to help new mothers initiate breastfeeding after delivery. Additionally, WHO provides training courses for health workers to provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers, help them overcome problems, and monitor the growth of children. Health workers are also trained to initiate Early Essential Newborn Care, a set of simple, cost-effective interventions that benefit all mothers and newborns.

    "text": "Buruli ulcer is a chronic, debilitating skin and soft tissue infection that can lead to permanent disfigurement and disability. It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an organism that belongs to the family of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and leprosy. Infection leads to the destruction of skin and soft tissue with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms. Patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability. Early diagnosis and treatment are the only ways to minimize morbidity and prevent disability. Only three countries in the Western Pacific Region are currently endemic for Buruli ulcer - Australia, Japan and Papua New Guinea. Three countries, including China, Kiribati, and Malaysia, were previously endemic for buruli ulcer, and where the current status is not fully known. Other than Japan and Australia, most of the countries in the Region is the lack of capacity to confirm the diagnosis of Bulcer. Symptoms of Buruli ulcer begin with painless nodules and swelling, usually on the arms and legs and sometimes on other parts of the body. These areas can then develop into large ulcers with a white and yellow base. M. ulcerans produces the toxin mycolactone. This has local immunosuppressive properties that enable the disease to progress rapidly with no pain and fever, making early detection difficult. However, if the ulcers are treated quickly, most will heal completely. If diagnosed late or left untreated, the condition can lead to scarring, permanent disfigurement, and disability. Treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics and complementary treatments (under morbidity management and disability prevention/rehabilitation). Current WHO recommendations are rifampicin 10 mg/kg per body weight daily and clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg per body weight twice daily. Treatment guidance for health workers can be found in the WHO publication Treatment of mycobacterium ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer) . In addition to the antibiotics and depending on the stage of the disease, other interventions such as wound care, lymphoedema management, surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting to speed up healing) and physiotherapy are needed. Psychological support may also be needed for those with severe disease. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis, so it is important to integrate a long-term care approach into the health system to benefit all patients.

One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, particularly in developing countries. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, it is estimated that close to 6.8 million new cases of cancer occurred in 2022 (3.6 million in men and 3.2 million in women). Cancer kills nearly 3.5 million people each year in the Western Pacific Region. Cancer prevention is highly cost effective and its economic and societal benefits are immense. Between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. There are primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and early detection measures for reducing cancer. Primary prevention refers to avoidance or reduction in cancer risk factors, the integration of activities to modify risk factors, and use protective of therapeutics: avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and decreasing red meat and fatty foods consumption exercise regularly limit alcohol use practice safe sex get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation Secondary prevention are those interventions that leads to early discovery and control of cancer. This includes screening for early detection and treatment of precancerous and cancerous lesions through HPV DNA tests, Pap smears, prostate specific antigen tests, and mammography. Tertiary prevention is started after a positive diagnosis of cancer and is aimed at improving quality of life and survivorship. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 9.7 million deaths in 2022. About 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease. The Western Pacific Region accounts for 36% of the global burden. In response to the increasing cancer cases in the Region, WHO has supported Member States to screen for cervical cancer especially in vulnerable and hard to reach populations.

They are the number one cause of death globally. CVDs include coronary heart disease (heart attacks), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), raised blood pressure (hypertension), peripheral artery disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease and heart failure. Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels – a heart attack or stroke may be the first warning of underlying disease. The major causes of CVDs are tobacco use, physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and harmful use of alcohol. Therefore, most CVDs can be prevented by addressing these behavioural risk factors.

    "text": "No woman should die from cervical cancer, a preventable and curable disease. Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Although most infections with HPV resolve spontaneously and cause no symptoms, persistent infection can cause cervical cancer in women. In the Western Pacific Region, an estimated 145 700 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2020, and 74 900 died from the largely preventable disease. HPV vaccination and screening and treatment of precancerous lesions are cost-effective ways to prevent cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine is most effective when it is given to girls below age 15, and all women should be screened for cervical at age 35 and again at age 45. Few diseases reflect global health inequities as much as cervical cancer. The majority of cervical cancer deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. This is also where the burden of cervical cancer is greatest. Access to public health services is limited, and screening and treatment for the disease have not been widely implemented. In 2020, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer as a Public Health Problem, which recommends a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control. To be on the path to cervical cancer elimination, countries must achieve the following targets by 2030: 90% of girls fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by age 15 70% of women screened by the age of 35 and again by age 45 90% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are treated. WHO developed a new Regional Strategic Framework for the Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer in the Western Pacific after thorough consultation with Member States, experts and stakeholders. The framework guides Member States to develop policies, implement programmes and shape advocacy for the elimination of cervical cancer in the Region. The needed actions include: Step up vaccination – Work to make vaccines more affordable and accessible, and integrate HPV vaccines into national vaccination programmes. Increase screening coverage – Strengthen the capacity of human resources for health and include cervical cancer screening and treatment of precancerous lesions into local, regional and national and cancer control plans. Timely and quality treatment – Set management guidelines for all stages of cervical cancer, ensure access to treatment and provide referral pathways for higher-level care, including setting up subregional hubs.

    "text": "Over the last 50 years, human activities have released sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to affect the global climate. The resulting changes in the global climate bring a range of risks to health, from deaths in extreme high temperatures to changing patterns of infectious diseases. Climate and weather variables pose threats to food and water security, and cause outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, the increased pressure on scarce resources triggers climate-related migration and conflicts. Under business-as-usual scenarios, it is estimated that between 2030 to 2050, climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths annually. Health systems must be made more resilient, especially in developing countries, in order to respond to the impacts of climate change. There is a need for an interdisciplinary and holistic approach among governments, communities and individuals coupled with changes in behaviour and practices in order to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure sustainability. Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations and those with underlying health conditions. In the short to medium term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points. WHO supports countries in building climate-resilient health systems and tracking national progress in protecting health from climate change, as well as in assessing the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from more ambitious climate action.

    "text": "Disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear in adults. When unaddressed, a person with hearing loss can experience significant impacts on communication, speech, cognition, and social interactions, as well as educational and employment aspects. The majority of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. The Western Pacific Region is estimated to have the highest prevalence of hearing loss in the world with approximately 7% of people experiencing hearing loss. By 2050, the Region is projected to host the largest number of people with hearing loss, approximately 760 million. WHO warns that a significant portion of these numbers in the Region consists of young people at risk of preventable hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices. This includes exposure to loud sounds on personal audio devices and in noisy entertainment venues. The WHO programme for prevention of deafness and hearing loss works towards the vision of a world in which no one experiences hearing loss from preventable causes and those with unavoidable hearing loss can achieve their full potential through appropriate interventions, education and empowerment. It aims to promote ear and hearing care (EHC), integrated within national primary health care systems. Deafness and hearing loss are widespread and found in each country in the Western Pacific. Currently, more than 546 million people live with hearing loss in the Western Pacific; 430 million of them have disabling hearing loss. In children, 60% of hearing loss cases are attributed to preventable causes. Otitis media is one of the most significant preventable conditions during early childhood in the Western Pacific Region. At the other end of the lifespan, approximately 30% of people aged 60 and older have hearing loss, mainly due to presbycusis. Without intervention, these conditions in older adults might present severe consequences for health and well-being. Many of the impacts of hearing loss can be mitigated through early detection and interventions. These include specialized education programmes and sign language instruction for young children and their families. Assistive technologies, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, closed captioning and other devices can help people with hearing loss at any age. People may also benefit from speech therapy, aural rehabilitation and other related services. WHO continues to support Member States in their efforts to address hearing loss in the Region.

WHO’s work is guided by the recommendations in the World Report on Hearing and the World Health Assembly resolution on prevention of deafness and hearing loss. In addition, the WHO supports Member States by endorsing the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific . This Framework encourage governments to adopt evidence-based, economical strategies and reshape their healthcare systems, transitioning from a \"sick system\" to a \"health system\" that fosters health-supportive environments and prioritizes individuals' needs across their lifespans. WHO’s work in the Western Pacific Region includes: Facilitating data generation and dissemination of ear and hearing care-related data and information, such as through the World Report on Hearing; Providing technical resources and guidance to facilitate planning and health systems capacity building for ear and hearing care; Providing guidance to strengthen rehabilitation for people with hearing loss through the Package of interventions for rehabilitation for hearing loss; Supporting health workforce training in ear and hearing care through the Primary ear and hearing care training resources; Observing and promoting World Hearing Day as an annual advocacy event; Building partnerships to develop strong hearing care programmes in the Region; Deafness and hearing loss Make listening safe Ear care Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) FAQ on hearWHO App hearWHO App Improving access to assistive technology (WHA 71.8) Prevention of deafness and hearing loss (WHA70.13) Prevention of hearing impairment (WHA 48.9) Featured publications World report on hearing Regional action framework for noncommunicable disease prevention and control in the Western Pacific The Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control provides a unified vision of objectives and recommended actions to combat...

    "text": "Dementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. It is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people worldwide, affecting individuals, caregivers, families, communities and societies. Dementia is not a normal part of ageing. People with dementia often live for many years after their symptoms begin, requiring long-term care and support. Dementia can be overwhelming not only for those who have it, but also for their caregivers and families. When resources are limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries, delegating dementia-related tasks and responsibilities to community workers can improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers. With the growth of ageing populations around the world, the number of people living with dementia is rising rapidly. Dementia is a syndrome characterized by deterioration in cognitive function, with Alzheimer’s disease as the most common form of dementia. While age is the most common risk factor for dementia, other diseases or injuries that affect the brain also increase the risk for developing dementia. Currently, it is the seventh leading cause of death among all diseases and is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people globally. Family members are often burdened with the cost of care due to the lack of trained professionals and access to programmes and services. Prevention and early intervention is key to improving health outcomes. The signs and symptoms of dementia are divided into 3 stages, although the exact presentation of dementia may vary across individuals depending on the underlying cause and specific circumstances. Early stage of dementia is often subtle, and include symptoms such as forgetfulness, losing track of time, and becoming lost in places that are familiar. Middle stage is when the signs and symptoms of dementia are clearer and may include, forgetting recent events or people’s names, becoming confused while at home, difficulty communicating, needing assistance in personal care, and behavioural changes such as wandering and repeated questioning. At the late or final stages of dementia, individuals living with this condition are nearly or entirely dependent on others. They may exhibit unawareness of time and place, having difficulty recognizing friends and family, increased need for assisted care, difficulty walking or moving, and behaviour changes that may include aggression. WHO recognizes dementia as a public health priority.

    "text": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily through Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus. It is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. More than 3.9 billion people in over 129 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with an estimated 96 million symptomatic cases and an estimated 40 000 deaths every year. Cases of dengue has increased over six folds since 2000. In the Western Pacific Region, at least 15 countries report dengue infections with many more cases reported every 2-3 years due to seasonality. During peak years, countries in the Region report an estimated 450 000 suspected cases. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2-7 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, sometimes causing complications or death. The most common symptom of dengue is fever which usually occurs after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito. High fever (40°C/ 104°F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms: Headaches Pain behind the eyes Nausea, vomiting Swollen glands Joint, bone or muscle pains Rash The disease may develop into severe dengue with the onset of warning signs occurring around 3 to 7 days after the first sign of illness despite a decrease in fever. Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in countries across the Western Pacific Region. Special attention needs to be given to these signs and symptoms as they indicate the need for immediate medical care. Severe abdominal pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding gums Vomiting blood Rapid breathing Fatigue/ restlessness Small red spots on the lips, fingers, etc. Most people who get sick with dengue will recover in about a week. They should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. There is no vaccine or specific medication to treat dengue. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and pain. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding.

    "text": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough of the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. Diabetes is one of the four major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and its global prevalence has been steadily increasing in recent years. In 2018, an estimated 131 million people in the Western Pacific were living with diabetes. In 2019, an estimated 262 000 people in the Region died due to diabetes. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes, but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms. The longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent and delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, be physically active, eat a healthy diet that limits sugars and saturated fats, and avoid tobacco use. People with type 1 diabetes require blood glucose control and daily insulin injections. People with type 2 diabetes can be treated with oral medication, but may also require insulin. Blood pressure control, foot care, and treatment for other complications, including screening and treatment for retinopathy, are also important. Diabetes",

It is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. Diarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. The danger of diarrhoea comes from dehydration. It is a major cause of death and serious illness in children under five years old. A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene. Most diarrhoea can be treated with oral-rehydration and zinc. Breastfeeding dramatically reduces the risk of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality.

    "text": "Digital health is increasingly playing a pivotal role in transforming health by leveraging technology to improve health and well-being. It has the potential to drive transformative primary care, radically change health services delivery, support the reform of health systems, and reshape the future of people centric health. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the adoption and acceptance of digital health services and systems, changing health-seeking and providing behaviours. This was most acutely seen in the areas of remote care and disease management, such as with telemedicine, digital surveillance, and other solutions to address the needs of patients. However, this rapid expansion of digital health has also brought new challenges, especially in the areas of governance and regulation, and ethical use of technology and partnerships. While the development of digital health is happening at an unprecedented scale, there is wide disparity in its adoption in the Region and its true potential is largely untapped in most settings in the Western Pacific Region. There is immense potential for Member States to leverage digital health effectively by addressing the emerging governance challenges, building people-centric health technologies, and navigating the rapidly evolving and changing digital health landscape. The interrelated social and technical health landscape in the Western Pacific Region varies by geography, heterogeneity of cultures and resources, and socioeconomic conditions. This variation characterizes the challenges faced, the potential solutions and consequently the priorities of Member States for developing digital health. Across the variation in digital growth and priorities, there are several commonalities in development in the digital landscape across the Region. There has been a rapid expansion in connectivity and smart phone usage. The familiarity of providers, patients and the people in general with digital health tools is driving an increased demand for them, beyond just the demand by health systems. Simultaneously, governments are also evolving in their approach towards digital health. Governments have proven increasingly willing to regulate and establish norms and standards on the use of digital solutions, which has increased investment in digital solutions. Non-traditional actors, such as tech giants, play an ever-expanding role in digital health, disrupting traditional service delivery channels. This dynamic has led to an increase in public-private partnerships and growing private sector participation in public health. Based on a WHO assessment of digital health capabilities in the Region, the areas of equity, digital literacy and stakeholder engagement have much room for growth, with data often not available. While there was significantly much more progress in the areas of governance, infrastructure, digital health solutions and financing, there is still limited or partial adoption across the Region.

WHO is committed to supporting Member States in leveraging the potential of digital health through ecosystems designed to provide people-centric health. Strategically designed digital health systems are central to achieving the shared vision of WHO work with Member States and partners in the Western Pacific Region. Priority actions for WHO in working with Member States include the following: Support Member States to develop digital health strategies that are aligned to the country's health plan. Support knowledge exchange and transfer of lessons learned in key areas such as digital health, governance, data management, workforce training and solutions development. Provide tailored technical support to Member States to act on the five strategic domains of the Regional Framework. Work as one WHO across all three levels of the Organization to provide harmonized, timely and feasible technical assistance to Member States; Generate a strong evidence base, in collaboration with academia and other partners, to inform digital health policies and deliver impact. Build a reserve of technical assistance through networks of experts, technical partners and collaborating centers. Strengthen strategic partnerships and alliances with (xxx) to support MS in building equitable, digitally enabled health systems.

    "text": "Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium which is spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. This bacterium produces a toxin that can harm or destroy human body tissues and organs. One type of diphtheria affects the throat and sometimes the tonsils. The infection can also affect the skin and, more rarely, mucous membranes at other sites such as the (ear, genitalia and conjunctiva). Diphtheria affects people of all ages, but most often it strikes unimmunized children. In temperate climates, diphtheria tends to occur during the colder months. The disease can be fatal. Between 5% and 10% of diphtheria patients die, even if properly treated. Untreated, the disease claims even more lives. The bacteria most commonly infect the respiratory system. Respiratory diphtheria usually occurs after an incubation period of 2–5 days (range 1–10 days). Depending on the anatomical location, respiratory disease may be nasal, pharyngeal, or laryngeal, or any combination of these. Pharyngeal diphtheria is the most common form. The onset is usually relatively slow and characterized by mild fever and exudative pharyngitis initially with progression of symptoms over 2 to 3 days. In classic cases, the exudate organizes into a pseudo-membrane that gradually forms in the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx. The pseudo-membrane is typically asymmetrical, greyish white in appearance and is firmly attached to the underlying tissue. Attempts to remove the pseudo-membrane result in bleeding at the site. The pseudo-membrane may extend into the nasal cavity and the larynx causing obstruction of the airways, which is a medical emergency that often requires tracheotomy. Anterior cervical lymph nodes become markedly enlarged and, in some patients, there is considerable inflammation and edema of surrounding tissues (“bull-neck” appearance) with greater morbidity and mortality. Absorption of diphtheria toxin into the bloodstream results in toxic damage to organs such as the heart, kidneys and peripheral nerves. The bacteria can also infect the skin, causing open sores or ulcers. The best protection against diphtheria infection is vaccination.

Absorption of diphtheria toxin into the bloodstream results in toxic damage to organs such as the heart, kidneys and peripheral nerves. The bacteria can also infect the skin, causing open sores or ulcers. The best protection against diphtheria infection is vaccination. WHO recommends a three-dose primary series and three booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. The recommended schedule of the three-dose primary series is with the first dose administered as early as 6 weeks of age; subsequent doses should be given with an interval of at least four weeks between doses, and the third dose of the primary series should be completed by 6 months of age, if possible. The three boosters should be given in combination with tetanus toxoid at 12–23 months of age, 4–7 years of age and 9–15 years of age, using age-appropriate vaccine formulations. For susceptible exposed individuals, vaccination with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine is strongly recommended.

    "text": "Disability is experienced when a person’s health condition and barriers in their environment prevent them from performing activities, like self-care, and restrict their participation in areas like education, work and community life. Health conditions, such as cerebral palsy, stroke, amputation and depression, may reduce a person’s mobility, vision, hearing, cognition or any combination of these. Physical barriers, stigma, and lack of access to assistive products and social support can make it harder for people with health conditions to access health services and lead healthy lives. Disability is a major public health issue in the Western Pacific Region, with more than 15% of the population experiencing long-term, significant disability. The prevalence of disability has increased significantly over the past 10 years as more people age with chronic health conditions. Communicable diseases and injuries, such as from road traffic accidents, also contribute to the prevalence of disability. Disability is a cross-cutting area in health, and it needs to be incorporated into the design and delivery of all health services at all levels of care. When health services are not inclusive of persons with disabilities, they can experience barriers that result in them having worse health outcomes than others. Persons with disabilities have worse health outcomes and die earlier than the rest of the general population in the Western Pacific Region. This situation arises because persons with disabilities disproportionately encounter poverty, discrimination, stigma and exclusion, and physical barriers. These can limit their ability to participate in education and employment and access health care. Health is a human right, and it is a state obligation to ensure that persons with disabilities can attain the highest standard of health. This can only be achieved when different sectors work together to create an inclusive and enabling environment for all and when health systems are responsive to the diverse needs of persons with disabilities. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States to achieve the best possible health outcomes for persons with disabilities in the Region. This is prioritized by: Making health services more inclusive of persons with disabilities. Including persons with disabilities in emergency preparedness and response. Cross-sectoral efforts to create environments that promote the health of persons with disabilities. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States by providing technical support, facilitating capacity-building, training health workers on disability inclusion, and generating data and guidance. WHO continues to strengthen its collaboration with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) in the Region, respecting the right of persons with disabilities to actively participate in efforts to enhance health outcomes and advance global health goals.

Regardless of the type of disaster, there are always impacts on health. The primary objective of the response to any disaster is to save lives and minimise disability and disease. However, the health system itself can be impacted by disasters, right when it is needed most. Hospitals and clinics can be damaged or destroyed and health workers injured or displaced. Disruptions in routine health services such as vaccination or vector control can lead to further waves of death, disease and disability as outbreaks spread.

    "text": "Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid, which can result in death, non-fatal injury (morbidity), or no lasting harm (no morbidity). In 2021, an estimated 300,000 drowning deaths occurred globally, with children and young people disproportionately affected. Drowning is the fourth leading cause of death among children aged 1–4 years and the third leading cause of death among children aged 5–14 years. Approximately 92% of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where the drowning rate is 3.2 times higher than in high-income countries. The Western Pacific and South-East Asia Regions account for the highest number of drowning deaths globally. In the Western Pacific Region, more than 84 000 people drowned in 2021—nearly 30% of the world’s drowning deaths. Drowning is the leading cause of death among children aged 5–14 years in the region. The regional drowning death rate stands at 4.3 per 100 000 population, higher than the global average of 3.8 per 100 000. While drowning primarily affects children, the highest rate of drowning deaths in the region occurs among those aged 70 years or older standing at 13.7 deaths per 100 000 population. Men consistently bear a greater burden of drowning than women. In addition to fatal drowning, many individuals experience non-fatal drowning, resulting in long-term health consequences and a substantial number of hospitalizations annually. Despite its magnitude and preventability, drowning often receives low prioritization in public health agendas—particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Risk Factors Drowning is a multifaceted public health issue, shaped by a range of individual, social, and environmental risk factors. Key risk factors include age, sex, poverty and inequality, occupational exposure, climate-related risks, transport on water, and migration and refuge-seeking. Age . Young children are at particularly high risk of drowning due to their underdeveloped ability to assess danger, as well as a lack of swimming and water safety skills. Risk increases significantly when children are in or near water without active adult supervision. Among older children and adolescents, factors such as growing independence, peer pressure, increased risk-taking behaviours, entry into the workforce, and experimentation with alcohol and drugs further elevate drowning risk. Older adults also face distinct risks, including reduced physical ability, mobility limitations, pre-existing medical",

Among older children and adolescents, factors such as growing independence, peer pressure, increased risk-taking behaviours, entry into the workforce, and experimentation with alcohol and drugs further elevate drowning risk. Older adults also face distinct risks, including reduced physical ability, mobility limitations, pre-existing medical conditions, and an associated increased use of medications. Sex. Globally, the drowning death rate for males is more than twice that of females. Males are generally more likely to engage in high-risk behaviours—such as swimming alone, swimming at night, or in open water—and are less likely to wear lifejackets. Alcohol use is also higher among males during aquatic activities. In addition, men are more frequently employed in work that frequently exposes them to potentially hazardous water, such as fishing, construction, transport and maritime occupations. Poverty and inequality . Drowning disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations. The drowning rate in low-income countries is 3.2 times higher than in high-income countries. Regardless of a country’s economic development, drowning often affects the poorest and people with low educational attainment who live in rural settings, especially where people have close daily contact with water for work, transport and agriculture. Occupational exposure. Fishers are among the most vulnerable occupational groups due to prolonged exposure to water under hazardous conditions. Long working hours, severe weather, and physically demanding tasks heighten the risk of drowning. Climate change has further aggravated these risks, increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and inland fisheries prone to flooding. Small-scale fishers are particularly vulnerable, as many lack access to lifejackets, emergency communication tools, and safety equipment on board. Climate-related risks . Climate change is significantly increasing the risk of drowning by intensifying extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Globally, floods accounted for 44% of all disasters between 2000 and 2019, with an estimated 75% of flood-related fatalities resulting from drowning. Rising global temperatures also contribute to more frequent heatwaves, prompting people to spend more time in and around water. This greater exposure, combined with increased alcohol consumption on hot days, further elevates drowning risk. Transport on water .

Rising global temperatures also contribute to more frequent heatwaves, prompting people to spend more time in and around water. This greater exposure, combined with increased alcohol consumption on hot days, further elevates drowning risk. Transport on water . Travelling on water, particularly in volatile weather conditions or without appropriate safety equipment, can increase drowning risk. In many low- and middle-income countries, water transport is significantly less regulated than in high-income countries. As a result, daily commuting often takes place on overcrowded and unsafe vessels, operated by staff who have not been appropriately trained to recognize dangerous conditions or perform high-seas navigation, increasing risk of boat capsize and collision. Migration and refuge-seeking. An increasing number of people are being displaced from their homes due to conflict, violence, political or economic instability, climate change, and other disasters. Many are forced to migrate through irregular and dangerous routes, which often involve crossing large bodies of water under treacherous conditions. These journeys are frequently undertaken in overcrowded and unsafe vessels, significantly increasing the risk of drowning. The 2014 WHO Global Report on Drowning outlines 10 evidence-based, cost-effective, and scalable actions for drowning prevention, adaptable to local contexts: A wide range of proven actions can reduce drowning risk across diverse settings. Installing barriers (e.g. covering wells, using doorway barriers and playpens, fencing swimming pools etc.) to control access to water hazards, or removing water hazards entirely greatly reduces water hazard exposure and risk, especially for young children. Community-based, supervised child care for pre-school children can also reduce drowning risk and has other proven health and development benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But this must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety. Training bystanders in safe rescue and resuscitation is also a vital component of drowning prevention. Survival in drowning incidents often depends on the immediate actions of those nearby. Equipping community members—particularly in high-risk areas—with practical, context-specific training improves the likelihood of effective and timely rescue.

Equipping community members—particularly in high-risk areas—with practical, context-specific training improves the likelihood of effective and timely rescue. It also reduces the risk of harm to would-be rescuers, who may otherwise attempt unsafe interventions. Effective policies and legislation are also important for drowning prevention. This includes setting and enforcing safety regulations for boating, shipping and ferry operations. In parallel, building resilience to flooding and other extreme weather events through strengthened disaster preparedness, land use planning, and early warning systems can prevent drowning during flood disasters. Developing a national water safety strategy can raise awareness of safety around water, build consensus around solutions, provide strategic direction and a framework to guide multisectoral action and allow for monitoring and evaluation of efforts. Public awareness and advocacy are essential to mobilizing action. Effectively communicating the human impact of drowning—while highlighting practical, life-saving solutions—can influence policy, empower communities, and drive investment in prevention. Mass media campaigns are particularly powerful in shaping behaviours and increasing public acceptance of safety measures, especially those that protect children. Finally, accurate and timely data on who is drowning, where, when, and why is essential. Robust data systems enable countries to design targeted, evidence-based interventions that respond to local priorities and reach the most vulnerable populations. Since the launch of WHO's Global report on drowning preventing a leading killer in 2014 and the follow-up resource Preventing drowning: an implementation guide in 2017, WHO has been working to scale up advocacy and action for the prevention of drowning. The Regional Status Report on Drowning in the Western Pacific provides countries with WHO-recommended best practices on drowning prevention interventions and policies, including day care for children, the use of barriers for controlling access to water, public awareness campaigns focused on behaviour change, and policies and legislation on water safety, including regulation of recreational boating and maritime transport.

    "text": "Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms that occurs in two main forms in humans: cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis. Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs. Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs. Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death. Both types of echinococcosis are expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. Most of the global burden of Echinococcosis is prevalent in China’s northern areas and Mongolia Cystic echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the parasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and size of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. In cystic echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys, spleen, muscles, central nervous system, and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Alveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs, and brain following the dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise, and signs of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is progressive and fatal.

If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is progressive and fatal. Both cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. The treatment used should be decided based on results from ultrasound images of the cyst. Treatments can include percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique, surgery, anti-infective drug treatments or simply watching and waiting. Human cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests. Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology. Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses.

Essential medicines are intended to be available within the context of functioning health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality, and at a price the individual and the community can afford. The Model List is a guide for the development of national and institutional essential medicine lists. It was not designed as a global standard. However, for the past 40 years the Model List has led to a global acceptance of the concept of essential medicines as a powerful means to promote health equity. Most countries have national lists and some have provincial or state lists as well. National lists of essential medicines usually relate closely to national guidelines for clinical health care practice which are used for the training and supervision of health workers. The concept of essential medicines is forward-looking. It incorporates the need to regularly update medicines selections to reflect new therapeutic options and changing therapeutic needs; the need to ensure medicine quality; and the need for continued development of better medicines, medicines for emerging diseases, and medicines to meet changing resistance patterns.

It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing a broad range of domains: public health, health research and clinical care. With competing interests under limited resources, a health ethics framework provides for a systematic analysis and resolution of conflicts through the evidence-based application of general ethical principles, such as respect for personal autonomy, beneficence, justice, utility and solidarity.

    "text": "In the Western Pacific Region, over 90 million people experience visual impairment, including 10 million that are blind. Blindness can be avoided in 8 out of 10 cases with appropriate treatment or early prevention. Eye health can be promoted through the integration of comprehensive eye-care services into existing health systems. General approaches are evidence-based advocacy, development and implementation of eye health policies and programmes, and multi-stakeholder partnerships to strengthen eye health towards achieving the global target of a 25% reduction in the prevalence of avoidable visual impairment by 2019 (from the 2010 baseline). The WHO Blindness Prevention and Control programme supports Member States to reduce avoidable vision impairment as a public health problem and to secure access to low-vision and rehabilitation services for those in need. In the Western Pacific, the most frequent conditions that can be targeted effectively with preventive strategies include congenital and acquired eye conditions, such as retinopathy of prematurity in newborns, diabetic retinopathy in adults, ocular infections and inflammations. Additionally, cataracts, refractive errors, and posterior segment disease are the most common causes of blindness and low vision in the Region. Interventions to prevent vitamin A deficiency, measles, trachoma, and rubella are highly effective in reducing the risk of eye conditions. A good example of prevention in countries of the Western Pacific has been the elimination of the bacterial infection trachoma, which can provoke blindness. Cambodia, China, and Lao PDR have been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma. Furthermore, in 2017, Vanuatu was the first Pacific island to eliminate trachoma. Although effective interventions and coverage exist to the Region to address two the leading causes of vision impairment - refractive errors and cataracts – countries are working to increase eye care. By 2030, all countries in the Region are working to increase effective coverage of refractive errors by 40% and an increase effective coverage of cataract surgery by 30%. Highly cost-effective interventions for these conditions, including spectacles and cataract surgery can substantially improve a person’s quality of life. Vision impairment that cannot be corrected or reversed requires rehabilitation measures, including low vision aids and assistive technologies.

    "text": "Access to safe and healthy food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health. However, unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances can cause more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. Examples of unsafe food include uncooked foods of animal origin, fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticides and faeces, and raw shellfish containing marine biotoxins. More than 50 000 people die every year in the Western Pacific Region from consuming unsafe food and another 125 million fall ill from unsafe food. Each year, 30% of cases of foodborne illness are in children under age 5 and an estimated 7000 children die as a result. Diarrhoeal disease agents are the main cause of foodborne illness; the most common disease-causing agents are norovirus, non-typhoidal salmonella and campylobacter, accounting for nearly 45% of all foodborne illnesses. However, Aflatoxins are responsible for many foodborne deaths in the Region. Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic development by straining health care systems and harming national economies, tourism and trade. The burden of foodborne diseases to public health and to economies has often been underestimated due to underreporting and difficulty to establish causal relationships between food contamination and resulting illness or death. Children aged 5 and under carry 40% of the foodborne disease burden, with 125 000 deaths every year. The consumption and production of safe food have immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet and the economy. Safe food is essential to human health and well-being, only food that is safe can be traded. Safe food allows for the uptake of nutrients and promotes long-term human development. The 2019 World Bank report on the economic burden of foodborne diseases indicated that US$ 110 billion is lost each year in productivity and medical expenses resulting from unsafe food in low- and middle-income countries. Unsafe or contaminated food leads to trade rejections, economic losses and food loss and waste, while safe food production improves economic opportunities by enabling market access and productivity.

WHO also calls for the transformation of food systems to make food safe, healthy and sustainably produced for all the world population. The Asia Pacific Health Security Action Framework (APHSAF) supports the objectives of global and regional strategies for food safety, including the WHO Global Strategy for Food Safety 2022-2030 and the Regional Framework for Action on Food Safety in the Western Pacific through strengthening capacities to detect, assess and manage foodborne disease outbreaks and One Health collaborations with animal, environment and food-production sectors. The Regional Framework for Action on Food Safety in the Western Pacific approved in 2017 has a timeframe for implementation of 2018-2025. It is intended to guide Member States on strategic actions and a stepwise approach to strengthen food safety systems to better manage food safety risks and respond to food safety incidents and emergencies, contributing to the Region’s health security. WHO enables resilient food safety systems through: providing scientific advice and research to help develop international standards for food safety through the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO Codex Alimentarius, monitoring the global burden of foodborne diseases and supporting countries in burden estimates, ensuring stronger national food control systems by comprehensive assessments through the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool, and implementing adequate infrastructure to respond to food safety emergencies through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN).

    "text": "Foodborne trematode (FBT) infections, taeniasis and cysticercosis are noteworthy neglected tropical diseases caused by trematodes (flatworms or “flukes”) or pork tapeworms. People become infected through the consumption of raw or poorly cooked freshwater fish, crustaceans and vegetables hat harbour the parasite larvae. Early and light infections often pass unnoticed, as they are asymptomatic or only scarcely symptomatic. Conversely, if the worm load is high, general malaise is common and severe pain can occur, especially in the abdominal region. Chronic infections are invariably associated with severe morbidity. Foodborne trematodiases result in severe liver and lung disease. Two species of FBTs (liver flukes) are confined to Asia. In some hyperendemic villages in Lao PDR, a record 80% prevalence of one species ( O. viverrine ) have been recorded. Eating raw fish and contaminated freshwater plants is a possible behavioural cause. WHO supports endemic countries in the WPR in conducting disease mapping, donation of Praziquantel for treatment and MDAs, and building capacity to diagnose, treat, and prevent cases of these Zoonotic diseases. Transmission of these trematodes is closely linked with food habits and hygiene in endemic areas. Therefore, food safety risk communications play a key role for the prevention of reinfection. As they are also zoonotic, veterinary public health and environmental measures, including treating domestic or livestock animals, enforcing separation between husbandry and humans, and draining grazing lands, might also be adopted. The public health burden due to foodborne trematodiases is predominantly due to morbidity rather than mortality with early and light infections often going unnoticed. Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the organ in which the adult worms are located in. Clonorchis and Opisthorchis species have adult flukes that lodge in the smaller bile ducts of the liver, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis of surrounding tissues. Acute or early infection may result in non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic infection can result in cholangiocarcinoma, a fatal bile duct cancer. Both C. sinensis and O. viverrini are classified as carcinogens. Fasciola adult worms lodge in larger bile ducts and gall bladder resulting in inflammation, fibrosis, blockage, colic pain, and jaundice. Chronic infection can result in liver cirrhosis.",

Fasciola adult worms lodge in larger bile ducts and gall bladder resulting in inflammation, fibrosis, blockage, colic pain, and jaundice. Chronic infection can result in liver cirrhosis. Treatment of foodborne trematodiases is important to prevent progression of clinical disease and reduce associated morbidity. Treatment can be offered through preventive chemotherapy or individual case management. Preventive chemotherapy involves a population-based approach where everyone in a given region or area is given medicines, irrespective of their infection status. This is recommended in areas where large numbers of people are infected. Praziquantel is recommended for the treatment of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis while triclabendazole is recommended for fascioliasis. Both praziquantel and triclabendazole can be used for the treatment of paragonimiasis. Individual case-management involves the treatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection.

    "text": "Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a particular society considers appropriate for men, women, boys, girls, and gender diverse people. Societal norms, roles and relations that are based on gender, can affect health by influencing the health-related experiences and behaviours of individuals and their relationships with others. Comparing data between women and men in the Western Pacific, for instance, women and girls may experience limited control over decision-making about their bodies, in their intimate relationships, families and communities, exposing them to violence, coercion and harmful practices, placing their health and wellbeing at risk. In comparison, traditional and rigid expectations of masculinity can increase men’s vulnerability to health risks and make them less inclined to seek health care in a timely manner. This, in turn, can contribute to delays in diagnosis, care and prevention, adversely impacting their health, and putting men at higher risk of dying from both infectious as well as noncommunicable diseases. Rigid gender norms can also negatively affect gender diverse people, who are more likely to experience violence and coercion, stigma and discrimination, including from health workers. Gender equality in health means that all genders experience fairness and justice in the distribution of benefits, power, resources, and responsibilities, so that individuals can realize their full rights and potential to achieve the highest attainable standard of health. Achieving gender equality in health often requires specific measures to mitigate barriers as well as to address systemic biases, promote cultural shifts, and foster inclusive policies that empower individuals of all genders. In the Western Pacific Region, the work of WHO is aligned with and supports the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages , and SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls . With this, WHO seeks to ensure that every person, regardless of gender, can live a safe and healthy life. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States to address gender-related barriers to health and ensure gender-responsive health service provision, information and delivery by: Engaging in technical collaboration to build national capacity for gender-responsive and transformative policy and programme design, implementation and monitoring, including advocating for active participation of all genders; Providing technical assistance to generate new evidence on gender in identifying and addressing gender-related issues and barriers through multisectoral and multistakeholder collaboration; Providing technical assistance to build national capacity on gender mainstreaming within both WHO and Ministries, across all technical areas of work",

    "text": "Health equity is the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically, geographically, or otherwise. Health equity is intricately linked to both structural and social determinants of health, as these factors influence the distribution of power and resources, as well as health outcomes, experiences, and opportunities within and across populations. In the Western Pacific Region, health inequities exist within and across countries, and are widening in some cases. Disaggregated data reveals variations in life expectancy, under-5 mortality, and other key health indicators among different population groups, highlighting the unequal burden of disease. Limited access to healthcare services, often influenced by preventable barriers, including financial constraints, linguistic and cultural differences, and a lack of access to pertinent health information, further influences health inequities in the region. Social determinants, including legal, political, cultural, educational, financial, and environmental factors, contribute to divergent and unequal health trajectories. The impact of these health inequities is profound, leading to compromised overall health and well-being within certain segments of populations. Beyond the immediate health outcomes, these health inequities have broader societal implications, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for educational and economic advancement. Addressing health inequities in the Western Pacific Region is not only a matter of public health but also a crucial step toward fostering a more just and inclusive society, with potential long-term benefits for both individuals, their families and society at large. Further, building resilient, people-centered health systems that acknowledge and respond to the needs of different population groups, will not only enhance access to health-care services for all and help achieve UHC, but will also ensure that communities experiencing social inequities receive equitable access to quality care. People living in the Western Pacific Region have a range of health experiences that are shaped by the social, environmental and commercial determinants of health. Although the Western Pacific Region has made progress on many health-related Sustainable Development Goals, inequities persist across many dimensions of health and impact both health status and access to services. Intersectional health inequities predominantly burden those living in poverty, with the least education, and in and remote areas.

People who reported having no education also have less knowledge of HIV than those with education, and people who are younger are more likely to die by suicide, in the Region. There is also a gender gap in some countries, where women are more likely to die as a result of NCDs, such as heart disease, than men. Health inequities not only impact health status, but also access to services – particularly reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health services. For example, people who live in rural areas, and have low incomes and lower levels of education are least likely to receive skilled care during childbirth. Children in poor households with mothers without education are less likely to be immunized. These are some ways the social determinants of health shape health equity in the Western Pacific Region. Efforts to reduce health inequities necessitate disaggregated data, evidence-based policies and interventions at the primary health care and community levels that consider the unique contextual factors within the diverse populations of the region. In the Western Pacific Region, WHO is guided by principles of proportionate universalism, acknowledging the necessity to address the varying needs of people living in vulnerable situations, while working towards solutions that enhance universal health coverage, high quality education, comprehensive social and labour protections and equitable application of legal frameworks. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports Member States to address health inequities by: Building capacity at national and local level in mapping, measuring and visualizing health inequities and their determinants within and across countries. Supporting in the establishment or strengthening of regional and national monitoring systems of social determinants of health and health inequities.

    "text": "The goal of health financing policy is to move towards universal health coverage (UHC) by ensuring adequate spending on health at national and local levels and effective allocation of financial resources to different types of public and personal health services. Putting in place proper health financing mechanisms can ensure that different population groups, especially the most vulnerable and high-risk groups, can access care and be protected from catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment due to health payments. Health financing has three core functions – collection, pooling and purchasing. Analysing the sources of funding channelled to the health system (collection), risk-pooling to share the burden of health costs through cross-subsidization by pool funding according to members’ health risks or geographically distinct health funding pools. Using different types of payment mechanisms (purchasing) can provide insights into the health system's efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and sustainability in moving towards UHC. C ountries can progress towards universal health coverage when people are financially protected while accessing health services. This requires ensuring that the health system can respond adequately to countries’ health challenges and that there are health financing mechanisms and arrangements that actively enable these goals. Despite improvements in health service coverage in the Western Pacific Region over the past decade, the proportion of households suffering financial hardship when accessing health services in countries has increased. In 2017, on average, 1 in 5 people in the Region incurred catastrophic health spending due to out-of-pocket payments when seeking care. This means that while there is better access to health services, more and more people are dealing with unaffordable healthcare. However, implementing sustainable health financing policies, arrangements, and mechanisms can reduce the risk of catastrophic and impoverishing health spending, reversing the negative trend to ensure a better, equitable and sustainable future for all. In the Western Pacific Region, the Regional Committee Resolutions on universal health coverage in 2015 and primary health care in 2019 emphasize strategic capacities and actions for health financing to improve financial protection. These include: financing health services using publicly funded, predictable, stable, and well-executed health budgets; utilising fiscal measures such as health taxes that create healthy behaviours; pooling funding across the health system to redistribute funds and delink them from patients’ ability to pay; coordinating and integrating health system and financing functions; having evidence-informed, performance-based, and sustainable budget allocation and hospital and healthcare provider payment mechanisms that support healthcare service delivery; implementing systematic and transparent mechanisms and institutions to develop and update the set of priority services",

Governments play a major role in setting the governance arrangements in the health sector. They act through a broad range of legal, policy, planning and monitoring instruments. Health service providers, both public and private, and citizens, further constitute the core actors in conventional health governance models. Linkages between these three groups are essential to health system performance and the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC). International organizations, corporations and other networks also play a role in health system governance.

It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions. As a core function of public health, health promotion supports governments, communities and individuals to cope with and address health challenges. This is accomplished by building healthy public policies, creating supportive environments, and strengthening community action and personal skills. In addition to ongoing advocacy efforts, the emphasis of health promotion in the Western Pacific Region is currently on building health promotion capacity (financing and infrastructure), urban health (including healthy cities and health equity), healthy settings (including schools and workplaces) and healthy islands.

    "text": "Research is indispensable for resolving public health challenges – whether it be tackling diseases of poverty, responding to rise of chronic diseases, or ensuring that mothers have access to safe delivery practices. Likewise, shared vulnerability to global threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus and avian influenza has mobilized global research efforts in support of enhancing capacity for preparedness and response. Research is strengthening surveillance, rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and medicines. Public-private partnerships and other innovative mechanisms for research are concentrating on neglected diseases in order to stimulate the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics where market forces alone are insufficient. Research for health spans 5 generic areas of activity: measuring the magnitude and distribution of the health problem; understanding the diverse causes or the determinants of the problem, whether they are due to biological, behavioural, social or environmental factors; developing solutions or interventions that will help to prevent or mitigate the problem; implementing or delivering solutions through policies and programmes; and evaluating the impact of these solutions on the level and distribution of the problem. High-quality research is essential to fulfilling WHO’s mandate for the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. One of the Organization’s core functions is to set international norms, standards and guidelines, including setting international standards for research. Under the “WHO strategy on research for health”, the Organization works to identify research priorities, and promote and conduct research with the following 4 goals: Capacity - build capacity to strengthen health research systems within Member States. Priorities - support the setting of research priorities that meet health needs particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Standards - develop an enabling environment for research through the creation of norms and standards for good research practice. Translation - ensure quality evidence is turned into affordable health technologies and evidence-informed policy.

The quality and availability of health workers in the right number and places determine a health system's overall effectiveness and strength. Health workers are the cornerstone of any health system and service delivery. Health workers are central to attaining, sustaining, and accelerating progress on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in health systems and widespread and continued underinvestment in the health workforce. Investment in the health workforce can yield far-reaching health, social, economic and security benefits for the 37 countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region. In the Region, the need to plan and manage a competent health workforce to adequately respond to the changing population health needs is well recognized. To address the Region’s challenges, the workforce envisioned for the future should be people-centred, culturally sensitive, adaptive, skilled in digital health, able to work and learn in teams, motivated and well-performing, and committed to professional development. The health workers also need to be protected, supported, and invested. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the Region’s health systems and widespread and long-term underinvestment in the health workforce. In general, more health workers are associated with higher UHC service coverage index attainment, affirming the centrality of the health workforce in delivering care to individuals, families and communities. Despite progress in the Region, critical gaps remain in the overall number, distribution and quality of the health workforce, as well as protections that ensure a safe work environment. In addition, ageing populations, a growing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and unforeseen health emergencies require a fit-for-purpose health workforce with evolving skills and competencies. The health needs of the population are rapidly changing. The proportion of deaths due to NCDs is projected to increase further in the future. The four main NCDs – diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases – account for nearly 87% of all deaths in the Region. Health emergencies and climate change add further risks to the population’s health. The implication is an expanding need for a greater variety and larger volume of health services.

Increased production of processed food, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium. Many people also do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and dietary fibre, such as whole grains. The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual needs (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle, degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. But basic principles of what constitute a healthy diet remain the same. A healthy diet is important sources of essential nutrients and helps protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. A healthy diet includes: fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g., lentils and beans), nuts, and whole grains, at least 400g of fruit and vegetables (i.e. 5 portions), limit foods high in fat, sugar and salt: total fat not exceeding 30% of total energy intake, saturated fat should be less than 10% and trans-fat to be less than 1% of total energy intake, reducing free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake and a further reduction to less than 5% is suggested for additional health benefits, and limiting salt to be less than 5g per day (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon). total fat not exceeding 30% of total energy intake, saturated fat should be less than 10% and trans-fat to be less than 1% of total energy intake, reducing free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake and a further reduction to less than 5% is suggested for additional health benefits, and limiting salt to be less than 5g per day (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon).

Settings can normally be identified as having physical boundaries, a range of people with defined roles, and an organizational structure. Examples of settings include homes, schools, work sites, hospitals, markets, prisons, communities, villages, cities and islands. Particularly vulnerable to health challenges and risks brought about by unsafe environments are children and adolescents. To ensure we provide a healthier future for them, we can invest in schools as ‘incubators’ for health, which can influence and inspire children and adolescents to be healthier adults and achieve their highest capability and potential.

    "text": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. There are five main types of the hepatitis virus – A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people globally, and together are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related deaths. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. As of 2022, an estimated 96.8 million people in the Western Pacific are living with hepatitis B and 7.1 million with hepatitis C. While there are evidence-based, effective and safe interventions to diagnose, treat, and prevent chronic hepatitis B and C, most people remain undiagnosed and untreated. Hepatitis B and C infections lead to chronic liver disease in hundreds of millions of people. They are the most common causes of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Most people with hepatitis A, B, C, E, or D have little or no symptoms, and often do not know they have it. Each form of the virus, however, can cause more severe symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A, B and C may include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). In some cases, the virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of death. Hepatitis D (HDV) is only found in people already infected with hepatitis B (HBV); however, the dual infection of HBV and HDV can cause a more serious infection and poorer health outcomes, including accelerated progression to cirrhosis. Development of chronic hepatitis D is rare. Hepatitis E (HEV) begins with mild fever, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days. Some persons may also have abdominal pain, itching (without skin lesions), skin rash or joint pain. They may also exhibit jaundice, with dark urine and pale stools, and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), or occasionally acute liver failure. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus. This vaccine also prevents the hepatitis D virus infection and given at birth strongly",

Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus. This vaccine also prevents the hepatitis D virus infection and given at birth strongly reduces transmission risk from mother to child. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. People who are diagnosed with hepatitis B should seek for further evaluation to start treatment. There are no specific treatments for hepatitis E viruses and hospitalization is not usually required. It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the negative effect on liver function caused by these infections. Hepatitis C can cause both acute and chronic infection. Some people recover on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low. Hepatitis A virus is most common is low- and middle-income countries due to reduced access to clean and reliable water sources and the increased risk of contaminated food. A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A. Most hepatitis A infections are mild, with the majority of people recovering fully and developing immunity to further infection. Protect yourself against hepatitis by always using sterile injections, always using your own razors and blades, practising safe sex, using safe tattooing and piercing equipment, and vaccination.

    "text": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens people's defence systems. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis and other infections. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of HIV infection and is characterized by the occurrence of more than 20 life-threatening opportunistic infections or cancers. HIV is spread from the body fluid of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. HIV transmission can be prevented with appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART). People taking ART who have no evidence of the virus in their blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. They can also enjoy healthy, long, and productive lives. Key populations and their partners face higher risks of HIV infection. This includes men who have sex with men, transgender, sex workers, people who inject drugs, and people in prisons. In the Western Pacific Region, they account for the vast majority of new infections. In 2023, an estimated 2.3 million people were living with HIV in the Western Pacific Region. Of the 2.3 million, 85% knew their status, 76% were receiving HIV treatment and 73% had suppressed viral loads. An estimated 140 000 [130,000–150 000] people newly acquired HIV, and 53 000 deaths were attributed to HIV-related causes. Despite notable progress in the response to HIV in the Western Pacific region, there are some worrying shifts. Since 2019, new HIV infections have increased by 8%, and deaths related to HIV/AIDS have risen by 10%. This is contrary to the global and regional target to significantly reduce new infections and end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030 as the sustainable development goal. Notably, only 66% of children with HIV are receiving treatment, which is lower than the treatment rate for all people living with HIV. These figures highlight the urgent need to enhance efforts to prevent new HIV infections and reduce deaths in the Western Pacific Region. HIV is fully preventable. Prevention interventions include condoms and lubricant, harm reduction (including needle/syringe programmes and opioid agonist maintenance therapy), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP; taking antiretrovirals before exposure to HIV) and post-exposure",

These figures highlight the urgent need to enhance efforts to prevent new HIV infections and reduce deaths in the Western Pacific Region. HIV is fully preventable. Prevention interventions include condoms and lubricant, harm reduction (including needle/syringe programmes and opioid agonist maintenance therapy), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP; taking antiretrovirals before exposure to HIV) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP; taking antiretrovirals after exposure to HIV). PrEP is a highly effective and safe HIV prevention option. WHO currently recommends three different PrEP products: oral PrEP containing tenofovir, the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) and now long acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA). Different products may be appropriate for different people depending on their circumstances and preferences. Unlike HIV treatment, PrEP is not lifelong and can be started and stopped to correspond with times someone may be exposed to HIV. PrEP should be offered alongside other HIV prevention options, including condoms and lubricant and harm reduction services. The risk of a pregnant women living with HIV transmitting the virus to her baby is between 15 and 45% without any intervention. However, identifying pregnant women living with HIV early and initiating and sustaining lifelong treatment for all women and girls of childbearing age living with HIV, can prevent transmitting the virus to their babies. Importantly, people who are successfully treated for HIV and have undetectable viral load, cannot pass the virus to their sexual partners. Within HIV prevention programmes, WHO supports the integration of hepatitis and sexually transmitted infection prevention, testing and treatment and the inclusion of services which address the sexual and reproductive health and mental health issues, that are also critical to acceptable and effective programming. HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of one or more medicines. ART does not cure HIV but reduces its replication in the blood, thereby reducing the viral load to an undetectable level. Effective ART prevents HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Someone who is on antiretroviral therapy and virally suppressed will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. WHO recommends that all people who have HIV should receive HIV treatment as early as possible. This means that people need to know they have HIV and have access to HIV diagnostic services.

In many countries, HIV self-tests are available so that people can test themselves for HIV. ART should be taken every day throughout the person’s life. People can continue with safe and effective ART if they adhere to their treatment. In cases when ART becomes ineffective - HIV drug resistance - due to reasons such as lost contact with health care providers and drug stock-outs, people will need to switch to other medicines to protect their health.

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) is impossible without clearly identifying the role of hospitals and optimizing their performance. Nevertheless, countries continue to struggle to improve hospital planning and management. Facility-level challenges such as weak management, escalating costs, long waiting periods, poor quality and safety, and low patient satisfaction impair hospital performance. At the level of the health system, challenges such as limited integration with primary health care, fragmented funding, weak regulation and inadequate monitoring undermine hospitals’ contributions to population health outcomes. These challenges occur against the backdrop of rapid population ageing, predominance of chronic health conditions, fiscal pressures, new medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, proliferation of private health care providers and growing public expectations. Given the vital importance of hospitals and persistent challenges, improving hospital planning and management has become a critical issue for countries in the Western Pacific Region.

    "text": "Human rights are universal rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The WHO Constitution was the first international instrument to enshrine the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being. In international human rights law, the right to health is a claim to a set of social arrangements – norms, institutions, laws and an enabling environment – that can best secure the enjoyment of this right. The right to health is an inclusive right, extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to health information, access to water and food, and housing. The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity or any other factor. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory laws, practices or policies. Violations or lack of attention to human rights can have serious health consequences for many, including people with disabilities, indigenous populations, women living with HIV, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender and intersex people. Health policies and programmes must therefore be designed and implemented through a human rights-based approach to improve the enjoyment of all people to the right to health. The human rights-based approach (HRBA) to sustainable development can be summarized as: Goal: All development cooperation activities should respect and advance human rights. Process: Human rights standards and principles should guide all development cooperation and programming activities from start to finish. Outcome: Development cooperation activities should contribute to states respecting, protecting and fulfilling their human rights obligations and ensuring all people can claim their human rights. The human rights-based approach: Employs an intersectoral analysis to identify the inequities which lie at the heart of development and works to end discriminatory processes and practices, gender inequality and unjust distributions of power that lead to groups of people being left behind; requires that the human rights principles of universality, participation, accountability, equality and non-discrimination anchor development work focuses on developing the capacities of states and partners to advance and respect rights and the ability of people to claim their rights; ensures that plans, policies and processes of development cooperation are anchored in international human rights law, and advance and respect civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights and requires that states and partners are accountable for their international human rights obligations.

    "text": "Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability. It disproportionately affects populations in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are weak. Hypertension rarely causes symptoms in the early stages and many people go undiagnosed. Those who are diagnosed may not have access to treatment and may not be able to successfully control their illness over the long term. There are significant health and economic gains attached to early detection, adequate treatment and good control of hypertension. Addressing behavioural risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity and tobacco use, can prevent hypertension. If no action is taken to reduce exposure to these factors, cardiovascular disease incidence, including hypertension, will increase. Many people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death. Hypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flood of blood and oxygen to the heart. Detecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions. Reducing modifiable risk factors is the best way to prevent hypertension and associated diseases of the heart, brain, kidney and other organs. These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults. There are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors. Hypertension can be managed",

Hypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions. Cessation of tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as improvements in diet and exercise, can help reduce symptoms and risk factors from hypertension.

Nutritionally adequate and safe complementary feeding starting from the age of six months with continued breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond. Exclusive breastfeeding means that an infant receives only breast milk from his or her mother or a wet nurse, or expressed breast milk, and no other liquids or solids, not even water, with the exception of oral rehydration solution, drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, minerals supplements or medicines. Complementary feeding is defined as the process starting when breast milk is no longer sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of infants, and therefore other foods and liquids are needed, along with breast milk.

    "text": "No one should get an infection while providing or receiving health care. Yet, healthcare-associated infections are among the most frequent adverse events occurring in the context of health service delivery. WHO estimates that 1 in 10 patients get an infection while receiving care. These infections, many of which are caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, harm patients, visitors and health workers, and place a significant burden on health systems, including the associated increased costs. By ensuring standard precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC) in health-care facilities, such as hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, waste management, and prevention of needle-stick or sharps injuries, 35–70% of health care-associated infections could be prevented. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has concretely demonstrated how critical infection prevention and control, including immunization, mask wearing, physical distancing and proper ventilation, is to maintaining essential health services and ensuring patient and health worker safety. Strong IPC programmes with empowered and well-trained IPC focal points are necessary to providing quality health services to patients across the Western Pacific and preventing avoidable infections. WHO in the Western Pacific is supporting Member States in identifying the barriers to strong infection prevention and control programmes in countries, and providing strategic recommendations to support healthcare facilities to take a grounds-up approach in strengthening IPC compliance, reducing healthcare-associated infection risks, and improving the environment for all health workers to take action at each step of health care delivery. Strong IPC programmes are critical to improving quality of care, strengthening health systems, achieving Universal Health Coverage, and tackling future outbreaks, pandemics and emerging diseases.

    "text": "Zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian or swine influenza, normally spread in animals but can also infect humans. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections (fever and cough), to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (breathing difficulties), shock and even death. Conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and encephalopathy (brain damage or disease) have also been reported to varying degrees depending on subtype. While recently identified avian influenza viruses do not currently transmit easily from person to person, the ongoing circulation of these viruses in poultry is particularly concerning, as these viruses cause severe disease in humans and have the potential to mutate to become more contagious between people. Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more frequently in A(H5N1) infection. Conjunctivitis has also been reported in influenza A(H7). Disease features such as the incubation period, severity of symptoms and clinical outcome varies by the virus causing infection but mainly manifests with respiratory symptoms. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs , notably neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival, however ongoing clinical studies are needed. Emergence of oseltamivir resistance has been reported.

The virus can be passed on from an infected person’s mouth or nose in droplets when they speak, cough and sneeze. It can also be transmitted when a person touches an object contaminated with flu viruses and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes. Influenza is a year-round disease burden Influenza causes various illnesses that can lead to hospitalization or, in extreme cases, death. WHO estimates it causes 290 000 to 650 000 deaths yearly due to respiratory diseases alone. Most influenza-related deaths in developed countries occur among people aged 65 and up. Meanwhile, research estimates that developing countries account for 99% of deaths in children under 5 with influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections. From an economic standpoint, a study predicted that the yearly cost of influenza pandemics is US$ 60 billion. More information about the disease burden of influenza may be accessed here . Symptoms are usually mild but can also be severe Influenza symptoms are usually mild but can also be severe, especially among high-risk individuals. Symptoms include: Fever Cough Runny nose Sore throat Fatigue (tiredness) Headache Muscle and body aches Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without needing medical attention. However, influenza can also cause severe illness or death, especially in people at high risk: Pregnant women Children aged between 6 months to 5 years Older adults (aged 65 and older) Individuals with chronic medical conditions Healthcare providers Prevention is better than cure Vaccination is the most effective way to keep the flu away. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 60 years. The flu vaccine is recommended for all. It is vital for people at high risk of influenza complications and those who live with or care for those at high risk. It is safe to get your flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine simultaneously. To prevent transmission, people are also encouraged to take the following actions: Keep hands clean by regularly washing them with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.

Those living in poverty are most vulnerable to infection. Intestinal worms are among the most common infections worldwide and affect the poorest and most deprived communities. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor. Intestinal worms are a major public health problem because the worms disrupt people’s ability to absorb nutrients, impeding the growth and physical development of millions of children. Deworming programmes with a single-tablet treatment can drastically reduce the suffering of those infected with parasitic intestinal worms and improve the health and nutrient uptake of heavily infected children. Improving basic hygiene, sanitation, health education, and providing access to safe drinking water are also keys to resolving the health and nutritional problems caused by intestinal worms. 13 countries in the Western Pacific Region require interventions and only 6 countries are implementing and reporting interventions. These countries include Cook Islands, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Philippines, Tuvalu and Viet Nam (where education ministries take a lead and ministry of health supplies medicines donated via WHO). Other countries, such as Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are also gradually scaling up, though involvement/leadership of education ministry is still limited. Cambodia and Viet Nam are covering women of child-bearing age also. Regular deworming of preschoolers is mainly supported by UNICEF using mebendazole. Morbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness, and impaired growth and physical development. Infections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically. S. stercoralis may cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children. In case of reduced host immunity, the parasite can cause the hyperinfection/dissemination syndrome that is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and is often fatal",

S. stercoralis may cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children. In case of reduced host immunity, the parasite can cause the hyperinfection/dissemination syndrome that is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and is often fatal despite the treatment. In 2001, delegates at the World Health Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution (WHA54.19) urging endemic countries to start seriously tackling worms, specifically schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths. The strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth infections is to control morbidity through the periodic treatment of at-risk people living in endemic areas. People at risk are: preschool children school-age children women of reproductive age (including pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women) adults in certain high-risk occupations such as tea-pickers or miners. The WHO recommended medicines –albendazole (400 mg) and mebendazole (500 mg) – are effective, inexpensive, and easy to administer by non-medical personnel (e.g. teachers). They have been through extensive safety testing and have been used by millions of people with few and minor side-effects. Both albendazole and mebendazole are donated to national ministries of health through WHO in all endemic countries for the treatment of all children of school age. Ivermectin for the control of S. stercoralis is expected to be available at an affordable price.

Legal frameworks organize and manage health systems, allocate responsibilities, set standards, authorize and constrain action, shape markets, alert people to particular health risks, and influence social norms about behaviour. Law for health extends beyond the health sector, such as trade and industry, finance, education, agriculture, road and transport, and environment. However, countries often struggle to effectively design, implement and evaluate legal frameworks due to lack of evidence, policy coherence, consistent enforcement, and monitoring mechanisms. Strengthening legal frameworks requires engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, including policy makers, regulators, parliamentarians, health providers, private sector actors, communities, and development partners.

    "text": "Leishmaniasis is caused by parasites that are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. There are three main forms of leishmaniases: – visceral (also known as kala-azar and the most serious form of the disease), cutaneous (the most common), and mucocutaneous. Depending on the type of leishmaniasis, symptoms can range from fever, weight loss, lesions and life-long scaring, and partial or total destruction of mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and throat. Kala-azar is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. Leishmaniasis is linked to environmental changes such as deforestation, building of dams, irrigation schemes, and urbanization. It affects some of the poorest people on earth, and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system, and lack of financial resources. Leishmaniasis is a treatable and curable disease. The Western Pacific Region is not endemic for Leishmaniasis although China is considered endemic with very low endemicity. No data has been reported in the last two years. Only 5 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were reported in 2015. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. There may be many lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability. When the ulcers heal, they invariably leave permanent scars, which can lead to stigmatization, especially for women and girls. Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver and serious anaemia. If the disease is not treated, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% within 2 years. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis produces lesions that can partially or totally destroy the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. This disabling form can also lead to social exclusion. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a complication of visceral leishmaniasis, is mainly seen in east Africa and south-east Asia. It is characterized by a discoloured (hypopigmented) flat skin (macular) rash, combined with some slightly elevated (maculop",

Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a complication of visceral leishmaniasis, is mainly seen in east Africa and south-east Asia. It is characterized by a discoloured (hypopigmented) flat skin (macular) rash, combined with some slightly elevated (maculopapular) or elevated (nodular) rash, usually in patients who have recovered from visceral leishmaniasis. PKDL usually appears 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of visceral leishmaniasis. It may occur earlier or even concurrently with visceral leishmaniasis, especially in Sudan. PKDL heals spontaneously in most cases in Africa but rarely in patients in India. Antileishmanial treatment depends on the causative species and the condition of the patient (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression). Regardless of the causative Leishmania species, antileishmanial treatment cannot provide a sterile cure, and the parasite remains in the human body and can cause a relapse when there is immunosuppression. Treatment is complex and should be administered by highly experienced health personnel. Most antileishmanial medicines are injectable.

    "text": "Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a chronic disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae . It is transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with untreated cases, but is not highly infectious. Mycobacterium leprae multiplies very slowly with an incubation period of about five years, but symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. If left untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. Leprosy is curable, and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability. Early diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT) remain the key elements in eliminating the disease as a public health concern. Since 1995, WHO has made MDT available free of charge to all patients worldwide. Symptoms may occur within 1 year but can also take as long as 20 years or even more to occur. Clinical signs are easy to observe. Skin lesion has usually a different pigmentation than the surrounding normal skin (less pigmented, reddish or copper-coloured) and may have various aspects (flat, raised or nodules). Skin lesion can be single or multiple and may show a loss of sensation in the skin. Skin smears are also used to diagnose leprosy. Leprosy can be classified on the basis of clinical manifestations and skin smear results. In the classification based on skin smears, patients showing negative smears at all sites are said to have paucibacillary leprosy (PB), while those showing positive smears at any site are said to have multibacillary leprosy (MB). Leprosy is curable with a combination of drugs known as multi-drug therapy (MDT), as the treatment of leprosy with only one anti-leprosy drug (monotherapy) will result in development of drug resistance to that drug. The combination of drugs used in the MDT depends on the classification of the disease (paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy). Since 1995, WHO has made MDT available free of charge to all patients worldwide.

    "text": "Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that can result in an altered lymphatic system and the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability, and social stigma. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The majority of infections show no external signs of infection, but they still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys, as well as alter the body’s immune system. When lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions, it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). In the Western Pacific Region, 24 of 37 countries and areas were endemic for lymphatic filariasis as of 2000. Since then, 13 of the 24 countries and areas have eliminated the disease as a public health problem. These countries include the following: Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Niue and Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Republic of Korea, Tonga, Viet Nam, and Wallis and Futuna. Other endemic countries are making progress toward elimination. Almost all the remaining endemic countries use a triple drug regime composed of three drugs for preventive chemotherapy campaigns called Mass Drug Administration (MDA). Brunei and the Federated States of Micronesia are in the last stages and are positioning for submitting dossiers for validation of elimination of the disease as a public health problem if the surveys show that the disease is no longer a public health problem. Whereas the disease was once thought to affect only adults, it now appears that most infections are acquired in childhood. Initial infection is followed by a long period of subclinical disease, which progresses in later life to clinically manifest disease. Lymphatic filariasis can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, that can be grouped into three categories: acute attacks, lymphoedema, and hydrocoele. The adult filarial worms cause inflammation of the lymphatic system leading to lymphatic vessel damage, even in asymptomatic people, and lymphatic dysfunction, which predispose the lower limbs in particular to recurrent bacterial infection. These secondary infections provoke “acute attacks”, which are the commonest symptom of lymphatic filariasis and play an important role in the progression of lymphoedema.

These secondary infections provoke “acute attacks”, which are the commonest symptom of lymphatic filariasis and play an important role in the progression of lymphoedema. Acute attack is usually associated with local pain, swelling, fever, and chills. Lymphoedema occurs primarily in the lower limbs and is common in women. In its most advanced form, lymphoedema may prevent people from carrying out their normal daily activities. Lymphatic filariasis may also evolve towards a genital disease (hydrocoele) that is characterized by a swelling of the scrotum and penis. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them suffer from damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and from an altered body's immune system. People infected with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also involves the Management of Morbidity and Disability Prevention (MMDP) that includes simple hygiene measures, such as basic skin care and exercise prevent acute attacks and progression of lymphoedema, and prevention of skin infections. For management of hydrocoele, surgery may be appropriate. MMDP also includes psychological and socioeconomic support for people with disabling conditions to ensure that they have equal access to rehabilitation services and opportunities for health, education and income. Activities beyond medical care and rehabilitation include promoting positive attitudes towards people with disabilities, preventing the causes of disabilities, providing education and training, supporting local initiatives, and supporting micro- and macro-income-generating schemes. Preventive chemotherapy is used at the community level to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt the transmission of infection by mosquitoes.

    "text": "Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, and vomiting, and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite. If not treated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening by disrupting the blood supply to vital organs. Malaria is preventable and curable. Control measures including insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying can prevent and reduce malaria transmission. Early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment of malaria reduces disease and can help prevent malaria related deaths. The best available treatment, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). In the Western Pacific Region, the key challenges to eliminate malaria include reaching the most vulnerable and unreached populations in remote and high-risk areas, preventing relapse of vivax malaria through compliant radical cure and halting transmission of knowlesi zoonotic malaria in Malaysia. Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, and lead to death. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur. Some population groups are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria, and developing severe disease, than others. These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers. National malaria control programmes need to take special measures to protect these population groups from malaria infection, taking into consideration their specific circumstances. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths, and also contributes to reducing transmission.

Many countries in the Western Pacific Region continue to struggle with undernutrition, especially affecting infants. Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning with exclusive breastfeeding until six months, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health.

    "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every pregnant woman receives safe and high-quality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal period. In collaboration with Member States, WHO promotes universal access to high-quality maternal health-care services, in alignment with the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health and Every Woman and Every Newborn initiative. Severe bleeding, high blood pressure, pregnancy-related infections, complications from unsafe abortion, and underlying conditions exacerbated by pregnancy are common causes of maternal deaths. Notably, most of these causes are preventable and manageable with access to high-quality and people-centred health care. WHO emphasizes the following strategies to enhance maternal health outcomes: Evidence-based policies: Developing and implementing effective and data-driven policies and strategies; Access to services: Expanding access to affordable, equitable and high-quality family planning, reproductive, and maternal health services; Effective interventions: Applying evidence-informed and practical health interventions throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period; Women’s health and nutrition: Improving the health and nutritional status of women of all ages, especially pregnant and nursing women; Community engagement: Engaging and empowering women, families and communities to support maternal health; Social determinants of health: Improving conditions in which girls are born and grow, women live, work and age, beyond the health sector Partnerships and investments: Strengthening partnerships to promote women’s health and well-being and increase investment in maternal and newborn health; Monitor progress and drive continuous improvement : Strengthen tracking system to monitor progress towards national, regional and global maternal targets while identifying gaps and areas for ongoing enhancement. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.1 aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030. In 2020, globally, 800 women died every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth which translates to approximately one death every two minutes. Despite a 42% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) over the last two decades in the Western Pacific Region, an estimated 8300 women died from maternal causes in 2020. Notably, significant inequalities persist across countries in the Region, with the lowest MMR at 3 per 100 000 live births compared to the highest MMR at 192 per 100 000 live births.

Trends in MMR in the Region showed a notable decline, decreasing by 35.5% from 76 per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 49 in 2010. However, progress slowed significantly in the following decade with only a 10.2% reduction between 2010 and 2020, reaching 44 per 100 000 live births. Improving maternal health is a strategic priority of WHO, firmly grounded in a human rights-based approach and closely linked to advancing universal health coverage. WHO in the Western Pacific works in collaboration with Member States to strengthen health systems and institutional capacities by developing and supporting implementation of evidence-based national policies, strategies, guidelines, and clinical protocols. This includes operationalizing robust data systems for effective monitoring, enhancing health system capacity, and empowering women to actively engage in their health-care decisions. WHO works to strengthen access to high-quality, respectful services across the continuum of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care through establishing routine continuous quality improvement mechanisms at all levels. Stakeholders jointly review the current intrapartum and early postpartum care practices, identify the quality gaps, develop an action plan along with setting targets, and implement routine measures for monitoring and undertaking improvement actions. To reinforce these efforts, WHO supports country-tailored support focused on providing high-quality basic antenatal, childbirth and early postnatal care to prevent and manage leading causes of maternal mortality properly and timely. WHO also promotes the integration of competency-based training packages into pre-service and in-service curricula, ensuring that future generations of health-care providers are equipped with the essential skills to deliver safe, dignified and respectful, high-quality maternal care.

    "text": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Rubella is a contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. The virus is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome. Over the past decade, measles and rubella cases have decreased dramatically in the Region, as millions of babies and young children have been reached with measles- and rubella-containing vaccines. However, outbreaks have occurred among children and adults in several countries, and children have missed routine immunizations due to health service disruptions and postponements of immunization campaigns during the pandemic. In 2017, the Regional Committee endorsed the new Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific , and urged Member States to eliminate rubella as soon as possible, and for each Member State to set individual target dates for rubella elimination. Eight countries and areas have been verified for measles elimination and 7 for rubella elimination. Measles cases went up 255% from 2022 to 2023 in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region, an increase caused by gaps in vaccination coverage and disease surveillance and travel of people from countries experiencing outbreaks. Measles is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Rubella is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. In children, initial symptoms include rash, low fever (<39°C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50–80% of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 1–3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful",

Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3–10 days. Once a person is infected, the rubella virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1–5 days after the appearance of the rash. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90% chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause the death of the fetus, or it may cause congenital rubella syndrome. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome may excrete the virus for a year or more. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles or rubella, but the diseases are preventable by vaccination. Measles and rubella can be prevented through safe, effective and inexpensive vaccines. Rubella vaccines are available either in monovalent formulation (a vaccine directed at only one pathogen) or more commonly in combinations with other vaccines such as with vaccines against measles (MR), measles and mumps (MMR), or measles, mumps and varicella (MMRV). Reaching all children with 2 doses of measles vaccine, either alone, or in a measles-rubella (MR), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) combination, should be the standard for all national immunization programmes. Routine measles and rubella vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with low routine coverage, are key public health strategies to eliminate measles and rubella.

    "text": "Several different bacteria can cause meningitis. Meningococcal meningitis is of particular importance due to its potential to cause large epidemics. Bacteria are transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers. The disease can affect anyone of any age, but mainly affects babies, preschool children and young people. The most common symptoms are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. If untreated, meningococcal meningitis is fatal in 50% of cases and may result in brain damage, hearing loss or disability in 10% to 20% of survivors. While vaccines against meningococcal disease have been available for more than 40 years, to date no universal vaccine against meningococcal disease exists. The largest burden of meningococcal meningitis occurs in the meningitis belt, an area of sub-Saharan Africa, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. The most common symptoms of meningitis are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. Even with early diagnosis and adequate treatment, 5% to 10% of patients die, typically within 24 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Bacterial meningitis may result in brain damage, hearing loss or a learning disability in 10% to 20% of survivors. A less common, but even more severe (and often fatal), form of meningococcal disease is meningococcal septicaemia, which is characterized by a haemorrhagic rash and rapid circulatory collapse. Meningococcal disease is potentially fatal and is a medical emergency. Admission to a hospital or health centre is necessary and appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible. Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible, ideally after the lumbar puncture has been carried out if such a puncture can be performed immediately. If treatment is started prior to the lumbar puncture it may be difficult to grow the bacteria from the spinal fluid and confirm the diagnosis. However, confirmation of the diagnosis should not delay treatment. A range of antibiotics can treat the infection, including penicillin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone.

    "text": "Mental health is critically important for everyone, everywhere, and goes beyond the mere absence of a mental health condition. It is integral to well-being, enabling people to realize their full potential, show resilience amidst adversity, be productive across the various settings of daily life, form meaningful relationships and contribute to their communities. Physical, psychological, social, cultural, spiritual and other interrelated factors contribute to mental health, and there are inseparable links between mental and physical health. Promoting and protecting mental health is also critical to a well-functioning society. It fosters social capital and solidarity, which are essential during times of crisis. The Western Pacific Region faces a looming mental health crisis, driven by social pressures, vulnerabilities and unrest, amplified by the wide ranging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities everywhere. Over 215 million people are living with a mental health condition in the Region. Suicide continues to be a leading cause of death among young people, and for every death, there are many more suicide attempts. At the same time, demographic shifts in some countries is increasing the proportion of older people contributing to the growing prevalence of dementia and other mental health conditions related to ageing. Rapid and unplanned urbanization give rise to built environments that are not conducive to health and well-being. Economic pressures, toxic online interactions and increased drug use can also cause stress and other direct threats to mental health. Substance use compounds the risk of developing a mental health condition and can lead to risky behavior especially among young people. Chronic exposure to adversity due to these and other risk factors increase the likelihood of developing a mental health condition across the life-course. The Region is also home to some of the most climate-vulnerable countries and areas in the world. Extreme weather events and other environmental hazards can lead to large-scale health emergencies and complex humanitarian crises, resulting in widespread mental distress and suffering. Communities residing in small islands and coastal areas are facing an uncertain future due to rising sea levels, leading many to feel anxious and afraid for their way of life.

    "text": "A newborn infant, or neonate, refers to a baby in the first 28 days of life, a period marked by the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Enhancing neonatal survival and health and preventing avoidable deaths and stillbirths requires achieving high coverage of quality antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care for both mothers and newborns. Neonatal deaths, which occur within the first 28 days of life, are often caused by conditions and diseases linked to poor quality care during pregnancy and childbirth and inadequate management immediately after birth and in the first week of life. The leading causes include preterm birth, birth asphyxia, infections, and congenital abnormalities. To accelerate progress in neonatal survival and promote overall health and well-being, it is essential to strengthen quality of care and ensure the availability of quality health services for well, small and sick child. Member States in the Western Pacific region have demonstrated a strong commitment to ending preventable neonatal deaths by introducing Early Essential Newborn Care – evidence-based, cost-effective and simple interventions proven to improve neonatal health outcomes. Global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.2 aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births by 2030. In the Action Plan for Healthy Newborn Infants in the Western Pacific Region , the Region aimed to reduce neonatal mortality to 10 or fewer per 1000 live births, extending the target up to 2030. Neonatal mortality in the Region has significantly dropped from 27.1 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 5.7 deaths per 1000 live births in 2022. However, 100 585 newborns still died in 2022 equivalent to one death every five minutes. Newborn death accounts for 52% of deaths in under-five children. Additionally, a stillbirth is defined as death of baby after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or during birth. In 2022, the stillbirth rate in the Region was 6 per 1000 births. Many of these stillbirths could be avoided through improved quality and respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth, including routine monitoring and timely referral to emergency care.",

Many of these stillbirths could be avoided through improved quality and respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth, including routine monitoring and timely referral to emergency care. The regional vision is to ensure a healthy start for every newborn. To achieve this, the Action Plan for Healthy Newborn Infants in the Western Pacific Region was endorsed as a road map for driving changes. Hence the Action Plan recommends evidence-based interventions that can be taken by governments and by development partners to improve neonatal survival and foster quality of newborn life. Nine priority countries, accounting for 95% of newborn deaths in the Region, have introduced and scaled up Early Essential Newborn Care (EENC) since 2013. This has led to significant improvements in practices including immediate and prolonged skin-to-skin contact, early and exclusive breastfeeding, delayed bathing, and Kangaroo Mother Care for preterm- and low-birthweight babies. In the past 10 years, EENC has been introduced in 6500 childbirth facilities, and more than 42 500 health-care providers have been coached. Five countries have successfully achieved the regional target of implementing EENC in 80% of childbirth facilities, while three more countries are on track. 93% of all term babies receive the first embrace immediately after birth. The regional result-oriented and data-driven approaches are to enhance quality of newborn care through applying routine monitoring and undertaking continuous quality improvement measures. Ensuring that no baby is left behind and giving every newborn the best start of life are core principles that support the vision of the Western Pacific Region with healthy families, communities and societies.

    "text": "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are not passed from person to person. They are of long duration and generally slow progression. The four main types – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – impose a major and growing burden on health and development. In the Western Pacific Region, 12 million people died from NCDs in 2019. Despite progress in reducing premature deaths due to NCDs from 2000 to 2010, new risk factors and changing environments have reversed progress in some countries over the past decade. The main types of NCDs share modifiable behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and harmful use of alcohol, which lead to four metabolic/physiologic changes – raised blood pressure, overweight and obesity, raised blood glucose and raised cholesterol, and ultimately disease. They continue to be an important public health challenge in all countries, including low- and middle-income countries where more than three quarters of NCD deaths occur. One of the most important ways of reducing deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is to control the risk factors that lead to their development. These include reducing the use of tobacco and the harmful use of alcohol, maintaining an active lifestyle and consuming a healthy diet. Actions towards these goals are cost-effective ways for countries to reduce the number of NCD deaths. Tackling these risk factors can not only save lives, but also provide a huge economic boost for countries. Beyond prevention, management of NCDs is critical. This includes detection, screening and treatment of the diseases, as well as palliative care for those in need. The vast majority of premature deaths from NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries, where universal health coverage or access to health care services is often limited. The development and promotion of universal health coverage is therefore essential in tackling NCDs and working to reduce the number of preventable global deaths. Surveillance of NCDs is another vital action for providing the information needed for policy and programme development for NCD prevention and control. Tracking and reporting on NCD related global targets and indicators to understand progress in NCD prevention and control are key activities. Accurate data from countries are vital to reverse the global rise in death and disability from NCDs, to support evidence-based decision making, and to help monitor and evaluate the progress being made.

Accurate data from countries are vital to reverse the global rise in death and disability from NCDs, to support evidence-based decision making, and to help monitor and evaluate the progress being made. WHO has worked alongside Member States, stakeholders, partners and experts to develop the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific , aimed at turning a “sick system” into a “health system” to end the NCD epidemic. It calls on Member States, partners and stakeholders to: Strengthen mechanisms for collection and use of data and information for planning, monitoring progress and evaluating NCD policies and programmes. Develop policies that go beyond the health sector to enable health-promoting environments and address social determinants of health at national and subnational levels. Screen populations for major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. • Strengthen primary health care to provide person-centred NCD management. Empower patients for self-management and adherence through health promotion, prevention and individualized data. WHO supports countries in adopting new solutions to the NCD epidemic through a regional “grounds-up” arrangement, in which the Regional Office or country offices identify common problems and help Member States develop customized solutions based on their local contexts.

Member States endorsed the WHO Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery 2021−2025 at the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly to optimise nurses’ and midwives’ contributions to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The Western Pacific Region has made good progress in strengthening the nursing and midwifery workforce. The density of nursing and midwifery personnel has increased in the last 20 years. Nurses and midwives make up two-thirds of health professionals. They play critical roles in various healthcare settings, ranging from tertiary care in hospitals to primary health care, where they are often the first and only contact point and health services provider to the people. However, many challenges remain to be addressed. The pandemic exacerbated the problems that marred nursing and midwifery, such as protection, fair working conditions, career pathways, retention, and migration. It poses a significant challenge for staffing in countries where human resources for health is already a challenge. In 2023, Member States endorsed the Regional Framework to Shape a Health Workforce for the Future of the Western Pacific at the Seventy-fourth session of the Regional Committee. The framework highlights nurses as a key enabler towards achieving UHC. It also provides priority actions to strengthen and retain the nursing workforce, including developing national nursing strategies, investing in nursing professionals, and enhancing quality-assurance mechanisms in education. The implementation of the framework will strengthen and protect nurses and midwives, allowing them to provide better and more efficient care, especially to vulnerable populations. An ageing population and the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases have continuously increased the demand for nurses in the Western Pacific Region. It is projected that the need will further increase in the future. These phenomena have also caused a change in the population's health needs. In response to the change, the healthcare delivery model has been transformed from hospital-centric to primary health care. Nurses and midwives need to be prepared for these changes. In the Region, people have experienced more frequent and harsh natural disasters, including cyclones, earthquakes, floods and bushfires, compared to the past. Emergency preparedness is critical to protect people, and nurses and midwives play central roles at the frontline once that situation happens.

In the Region, people have experienced more frequent and harsh natural disasters, including cyclones, earthquakes, floods and bushfires, compared to the past. Emergency preparedness is critical to protect people, and nurses and midwives play central roles at the frontline once that situation happens. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the pre-existing hardships on nurses, forcing them to either quit the profession altogether or seek better opportunities internationally, which in turn is impacting the sustainability of health systems in vulnerable countries. The new Regional Framework to Shape a Health Workforce for the Future of the Western Pacific highlights nurses as a key enabler towards achieving UHC. It provides priority actions to strengthen and retain the nursing workforce: Develop national nursing strategies, invest in nursing professionals, and involve them in decision-making on nursing and health policies to ensure nurses optimally contribute to achieving UHC. Expand the scope of practice of nurses, including the introduction of nurse practitioners, to improve people’s access to PHC. Update and upgrade curricula for nurses to meet population health needs. Enhance quality-assurance mechanisms in education, including a licensing system and its renewal with continuing professional development (CPD) and accreditation mechanisms and with standards for education and institutions to protect the public.

Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity. Malnutrition, in all its forms, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries. WHO is providing scientific advice and decision-making tools that can help countries take action to address all forms of malnutrition to support health and wellbeing for all, at all ages. Essential nutrition actions to achieve optimum health and nutritional well-being are identified throughout the course of life. The Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition aim to end hunger and eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide. The two faces of malnutrition include undernutrition, such as wasting, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as those associated with dietary imbalance and excess, such as overweight, obesity, or diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). There is a potential of double-duty actions to effectively and simultaneously address the global challenge of double burden of malnutrition. Double-duty actions through integrated interventions, programmes and policies have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes across the spectrum of malnutrition.

WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed. Mothers should be counselled that the benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks for transmission. Childhood overweight and obesity In the Western Pacific Region, there has been a remarkable increase in childhood overweight and obesity over the past decades. Children and adolescents who are obese are more prone to becoming obese adults, and this poses an increased risk of serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Food marketing WHO supports country-specific actions to improve the food environment for children through multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The Regional Action Framework on Protecting Children from the Harmful Impact of Food Marketing aims to support Member States in their efforts to protect children from the harmful impact of food marketing, as appropriate to national contexts. It is guided by the principles of government leadership, evidence-driven and rights-based approaches, equity, and ensuring safeguards against conflicts of interest. Healthy diet While governments, policy makers and society can collectively act against overweight and obesity, it is also crucial to promote healthy diets among children and adolescents: eliminating excessive intake of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fatty acids. Together, we can all promote nutrition in building a healthier and more productive future generation.

    "text": "Obesity is one of the most serious global public health challenges of the 21st century, affecting every country in the Western Pacific Region. Obesity in adulthood is a major risk factor for the world’s leading causes of poor health and early death including cardiovascular disease, several common cancers, diabetes and osteoarthritis. Preventing obesity has direct benefits for health and wellbeing, in childhood and continuing into adulthood. Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. In adults, a body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In children aged between 5–19 years, overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median. In children under 5 years of age, overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median. Prevalence of overweight and obesity continue to grow in children and adults across countries in the Region. The epidemic has been growing most rapidly in lower-middle income and middle-income countries particularly in the Pacific island countries and areas. Although most countries are still off-track to meet the 2025 targets, many are taking action, and some have achieved a levelling-off in childhood obesity rates. Most countries in the Region are off track in achieving the global targets of halting overweight and obesity in children and adults. Obesity prevention requires action throughout the life course, starting before birth. Good nutrition in early life is crucial to lifelong health, and breastfeeding is recognized to protect against childhood obesity. For infants and young children, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years and beyond are recommended. These support not only reducing the risk of undernutrition and obesity but also to ensure optimal growth. For older children and adults, healthy eating habits such as limiting energy intake from total fats and sugars, increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity may prevent obesity. Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping people’s choices. By making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), overweight and obesity may be prevented.

Key actions to improve healthy environments include regulating food marketing to children, nutrition labelling, fiscal policy, school nutrition policies, actions to support the early food environments, and promoting physical activity. WHO continues to support Member States in their efforts to address obesity in the Region. This includes technical support for the implementation of the \" Regional action framework on protecting children from the harmful impact of food marketing in the Western Pacific \". The Framework aims to support Member States to implement actions that effectively protect children from the marketing of food high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars or salt, and protect caregivers from the marketing of breast-milk substitutes and inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children. Additionally, WHO support Member States through the \"Regional action framework for noncommunicable disease prevention and control in the Western Pacific\". The Framework calls on governments to implement evidence-based, cost-effective policies and reorient their health systems to transform the current “sick system” to a “health system” where societies build health-enabling environments and health systems become more people-centred, accompanying individuals throughout their lives.

It is especially important given that people spend on average one-third of their lives in the workplace where they produce all the goods and services of countries. Currently, the majority of workers do not have access even to basic occupational health services, which include prevention of occupational risks, health surveillance, and training in safe working. The most vulnerable groups are workers at small and medium-sized enterprises, agricultural workers, and workers in the informal sector.

    "text": "Oral health is essential to overall health, well-being, and quality of life across the life course. It enables us to eat, speak and socialize in the community. Most oral diseases are preventable and can be treated in their early stages. Through reducing risk factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diets high in free sugars, many oral diseases and leading noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, can be prevented. The burden of oral diseases is high in the Western Pacific Region. In 2019, an estimated 800 million people or 42% or the population were affected by oral diseases, including untreated dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal (gum) diseases, and tooth loss. Oral health promotion and oral disease prevention should be integrated with other noncommunicable disease prevention programmes that share common risk factors and social determinants. Also, integrating oral health services in primary health care is essential to provide more equitable access to comprehensive care. The most common oral diseases are dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal (gum) diseases, and oral cancer. Dental caries results from plaque that forms on a tooth surface and converts the free sugars from foods and drinks into acids that case a breakdown of tooth enamel over time. Unhealthy diets, including continuous consumption of free sugars, and poor oral hygiene lacking fluoride exposure and toothbrushing to remove plaque can lead to dental caries. Pain, infection and tooth loss can also result if not treated early. Periodontal disease includes gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis causes swollen, painful or bleeding gums and bad breath. In its more severe form, periodontitis causes a loss of connective tissue and bones resulting in tooth loss. The main causes of periodontal disease include poor oral hygiene and tobacco use. Oral cancer is cancer that develops in the lip and all parts of the oral cavity, and oropharynx. The initial symptoms include a persistent ulceration, pain, swelling, bleeding of the soft tissue, and difficulty in eating or speaking. The risk factors include tobacco use, areca nuts or betel quid chewing, and excessive alcohol consumption. Other oral diseases include cleft lip and palate, oral manifestation of HIV, and oro-dental trauma. Most oral diseases are preventable.

Other oral diseases include cleft lip and palate, oral manifestation of HIV, and oro-dental trauma. Most oral diseases are preventable. Oral health promotion and oral disease prevention, such as national oral health campaigns, can be cost-effective and reach wider populations. However, investments in oral health are limited. According to the WHO Country Capacity Survey conducted in 2019, half of countries in the Western Pacific do not have an oral health policy, strategy or action plan. Moreover, oral health services are often not covered within universal health coverage benefit packages. Basic prevention methods, such as toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste are not affordable or widely available, especially for the most vulnerable populations. Since the Western Pacific Region has one of the largest and fastest growing older populations, oral health promotion should be accelerated in all countries to support healthy ageing. In 2021, Member States adopted an oral health resolution which recommends that countries shift their approach from focusing mostly on treating and curing oral health diseases towards prevention through promoting good oral hygiene, healthy eating and regular dental visits. This shift will contribute to addressing key risk factors of oral diseases and noncommunicable diseases in the Region. WHO in the Western Pacific assists Member States by advocating for oral health, providing technical support on development and implementation of national oral health policies, and supporting inclusion of oral health services into universal health coverage benefit packages.

    "text": "Patient safety is fundamental to the provision of health care in all settings. However, avoidable adverse events, errors and risks associated with health care remain major challenges for patient safety globally. Every point in the process of care-giving contains a certain degree of risk to patient safety. Adverse events, or safety mishaps, may result from problems in practice, products, procedures or systems. Patient safety incidents can also cause death and disability, and suffering for victims and their families. The financial and economic costs of safety lapses are high. Patient safety improvements demand a system-wide effort, involving actions in performance improvement, environmental safety and risk management, such as infection control, safe use of medicines, equipment safety, safe clinical practice and safe environment of care. Orienting health systems to the delivery and improvement of quality is fundamental to progress and to meeting the expectations of both populations and health care workers. Every year, large numbers of patients are harmed or die because of unsafe health care, creating a high burden of death and disability worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. On average, an estimated one in 10 patients is subject to an adverse event while receiving hospital care in high-income countries. Available evidence suggests that 134 million adverse events due to unsafe care occur in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries, contributing to around 2.6 million deaths every year. People mostly link patient safety with hospital-based care; however, unsafe care is a systemwide problem. Half of the global disease burden arising from patient harm originates in primary and ambulatory care. Unsafe medication practices and errors – such as incorrect dosages or infusions, unclear instructions, use of abbreviations and inappropriate or illegible prescriptions – are also a leading cause of avoidable harm in health care worldwide. Globally, the cost associated with medication errors has been estimated at US$ 42 billion a year. Recognizing the huge burden of patient harm in health care, the 72nd World Health Assembly, in May 2019, adopted a resolution (WHA72.6) on “Global action on patient safety”, which endorsed the establishment of World Patient Safety Day, to be observed every year on 17 September; and recognized “patient safety as a global health priority”. The resolution urges Member States to recognize patient safety as a key priority in health sector policies and programmes, and requests the Director-General of WHO to emphasize patient safety as a key strategic priority in WHO’s work, especially within the universal health coverage (",

The resolution also requests WHO’s Director-General “to formulate a global patient safety action plan in consultation with Member States, regional economic integration organizations and all relevant stakeholders, including in the private sector”. This plan will be based on the guiding principles of equity, sustainability and accountability. The proposed action plan will seek inspiration and coherence with existing global action plans developed by WHO and other global health and development agencies. Responding to the unprecedented global patient safety movement, the need for very urgent and concerted action in this area, and aligning with the Sustainable Developmental Goals, WHO’s Director-General launched the WHO Flagship Initiative “A Decade of Patient Safety 2020-2030” in February 2020.

    "text": "Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial disease of the respiratory tract. It occurs mainly in infants and young children. It is easily transmitted from person to person, mainly through droplets. In 2022, there were more than 62 500 cases of pertussis globally and nearly 39 000 cases were reported in the Western Pacific Region. Pertussis can be prevented by immunization. The Western Pacific Region had 93% coverage with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine in 2022. Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . Pertussis spreads easily from person to person mainly through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The disease is most dangerous in infants and is a significant cause of disease and death in this age group. The first symptoms generally appear 7-10 days after infection and include mild fever, runny nose and cough, which typically develops into a paroxysmal cough followed by a whooping noise (hence the common name of whooping cough). Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, and seizures and brain disease occur rarely. People with pertussis are most contagious up to about 3 weeks after the cough begins, and many children who contract pertussis have coughing spells that last 4 to 8 weeks. Antibiotics are used to treat the infection. The best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization. The three-dose primary series diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) (-containing) vaccines decrease the risk of severe pertussis in infancy. In 2022, 93% of the target population in the Western Pacific Region had received the recommended 3 doses of DTP-containing vaccine during infancy. WHO recommends the first dose be administered as early as 6 weeks of age; with subsequent doses given 4-8 weeks apart, at age 10-14 weeks and 14-18 weeks. A booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year of life. Based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be warranted later in life. Vaccination of pregnant women is effective in preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated. National programmes may consider vaccination of pregnant women with pertussis-containing vaccine as a strategy additional to routine primary infant pertussis vaccination in countries or settings with high",

Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Pneumonia can be prevented with simple interventions and treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care. Depending on the severity of the pneumonia, signs and symptoms may include: Cough Shortness of breath Fever, sweating and shaking chills Fatigue Chest pain Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Confusion, especially in older adults Pneumonia may be treated with antibiotics, if it is bacterial. The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia. Rest and plenty of hydration can also help people recover quicker. People of all ages can reduce their risk of pneumonia by: Get vaccinated: Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles, influenza and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Wash your hands: Maintain good hygiene and wash your hands frequently, especially when caring for others who are sick or after blowing your nose, will keep germs from spreading. Address environmental factors: Reduce indoor air pollution by providing affordable clean indoor stoves and stop smoking. Maintain healthy lifestyle: Eat a healthy diet, rest and get regular exercise to help you stay well. Adequate nutrition is key to improving natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.

    "text": "Since 2000, the Western Pacific Region has maintained polio-free status. Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease caused by a poliovirus. It mainly affects children under 5 years of age but also can affect older age groups. Polioviruses are spread by faecal-to-oral and oral-to-oral transmission. Lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation is a major risk factor for transmission. Most infected people have no symptoms but can transmit infection to others by excreting the virus in their faeces. It is estimated that one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5–10% will die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. There is no cure for polio; however, it can be prevented by vaccination. Poliovirus is highly infectious. The incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. The virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It then invades the nervous system. Up to 90% of those infected experience no or mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized. In others, initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. These symptoms usually last for 2–10 days and most recovery is complete in almost all cases. However, in the remaining proportion of cases the virus causes paralysis, usually of the legs, which is most often permanent. Of those paralysed, 5-10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. There is no cure for polio; it can only be prevented by immunization. The polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. If enough people in a community are immunized against polio, the virus will be deprived of susceptible hosts and will die out. High levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks occurring. WHO is continuing to work with countries in the Region to stop the use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and use only inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization schedules, to prevent the emergence and circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses in the future.

    "text": "Primary health care (PHC) refers to a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution. This is through focusing on people’s needs as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. It should also be as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment. PHC comprises of comprehensive integrated health services; multi-sectoral policies and actions to address wider determinants of health; and empowering individuals and communities for increased participation in health. PHC aims to take a whole-of government approach to health with a strong focus on equity. It includes comprehensive interventions that encompass the entire life-course. It also addresses the broader determinants of health and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. WHO’s Western Pacific Regional Office along with its Country Offices is supporting countries to build health systems of the future oriented towards primary health care. This includes using evidence to provide advice on appropriate policies and actions to provide better-quality PHC services and address the social and economic determinants of health. WHO also continues to advocate for stronger political commitment and investment in primary health care across the Region. A rapidly ageing population, increased burden of noncommunicable diseases and health security risks, worsening economic outlook, and other changes in the Western Pacific Region are transforming peoples’ health today and into the future. These changes are compounding existing gaps in national health systems across the Region. Many countries face health worker shortages, many people are pushed into poverty due to excessive healthcare costs, and many groups still face barriers to accessing health services due to cost, location or other social and cultural factors. Primary health care of the future needs a stronger focus on empowering individuals and communities to participate in decisions that impact their health and to play a greater role in maintaining healthy lifestyles. Involving individuals and communities also works towards increasing the voices of marginalized and vulnerable groups in their care. There needs to be an enabling environment to harness innovations, both social and technological, to transform and improve primary health care design and delivery. This draws on the principle of human-centred design in how primary health care services are planned and delivered. As Member States aim to transform their health systems to meet these present and future challenges, adopting a new approach to primary health care will be essential. Primary health care for the future needs to build systems that not only treat illness but continually interact with patients and people to maintain health and well-being. Transform",

Primary health care for the future needs to build systems that not only treat illness but continually interact with patients and people to maintain health and well-being. Transforming health systems also means establishing health services that are tailored to the needs of individuals and rebuilding trust in primary health care. In partnership with Member States, WHO has developed the new Regional Framework on the Future of Primary Health Care in the Western Pacific. WHO is committed to primary health care as a top priority and an overarching vision for health sector transformation. It is also essential for global progress on universal health coverage (UHC). WHO advocates to Member States for more political commitment and greater investment in strengthening primary health care and works to engage other sectors that have a positive impact on health. WHO supports countries in developing national health policies, strategies and plans that focus on primary health care, and, where needed, it builds country capacity and facilitates joint learning. WHO provides tailored advice based on evidence to guide countries’ actions to provide better-quality services and reduce the barriers people face in accessing primary health care. WHO partners with other stakeholders at regional and country levels to support countries in implementing primary health-care reform in a way that matches their local context.

    "text": "Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease. Dogs are the source of the vast majority of rabies virus transmission, through bites or scratches, usually via saliva. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. Clinically, it has two forms: Furious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations. Paralytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma. Rabies is classified as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) that predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations. In the Western Pacific Region, 7 countries, including Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philppines and Viet Nam, are considered high risk for rabies. Rabies elimination is feasible through vaccination of dogs, prevention of dog bites and ensuring universal access to post-exposure immunization. This requires a whole-of-system approach with a multisectoral interventions and community engagement. WHO closely collaborates and collaborates with the the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to support Member States in their efforts to eliminate rabies as a public health problem by 2030. Early symptoms of a rabies infection can include a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. In later states, the virus spreads to the central nervous system, causing fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The incubation period of the disease can vary from 1 week to 1 year, though it is typically 2–3 months. The two types of rabies show different symptoms. Furious rabies causes signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies, which accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases, runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people,",

The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and human rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, particularly a dog: Wash the wound immediately with soap or detergent. Flush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. Apply an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication to the wound 15 minutes after it has been washed and flushed. Avoid applying irritants to the wounds such as chili powder, plant juices, acids and alkalis. Avoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages. Seek transportation to a health care facility for further assessment and treatment by a healthcare professional. If possible, safely confine the biting animal and collect information on it and the bite circumstance to provide to the health care professional and public health officer. Keep the biting animal confined and under observation for 10 days. WHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs, dog bite prevention strategies, and more widespread use of the intradermal route for post-exposure prophylaxis, which reduces volume and therefore the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.

    "text": "Rehabilitation aims to support anyone with an injury, illness or development condition who experiences short- or long-term impairment and limitations in functioning. Rehabilitation can also be an important health service for people as they age, helping them remain active and independent for as long as possible. As part of the continuum of care, rehabilitation builds on curative interventions to help people address problems with communication, cognition, mobility, and self-care. Rehabilitation interventions may involve a combination of therapeutic techniques, environmental modification, and assistive technology, as well as education and advice. For many, it is an essential health service that enables participation in education, work and community life. It is estimated that 610 million – or 1 in 3 people - in the Western Pacific Region experience a health condition that could benefit from rehabilitation. The need for rehabilitation and assistive technology continues to grow as populations age; there are 245 million people 65 years and older in the Western Pacific, which is predicted to double by 2050. Rehabilitation needs are also increasing with the rise of noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke, cardiorespiratory diseases, and diabetes, which are the leading cause of death and disability in the Region. The high number of road traffic accidents further increases the risk of injury and trauma for which rehabilitation is required. While the need for rehabilitation is immense and continues to grow, services are often underdeveloped and undervalued, particularly when health systems are not strong. As a result, 50% of people are estimated to fail to receive the rehabilitation they need. Access to quality rehabilitation can profoundly impact individuals and their families, enabling people with health conditions to pursue education, work, and recreational goals. Rehabilitation also has an important economic and social impact because it can support people to live more independently for longer, reduce or prevent hospital admissions, and improve health outcomes. Rehabilitation is an essential part of emergency preparedness and response, which is highly relevant to many countries in the Western Pacific Region. Despite this, rehabilitation is too often neglected and avoidably disrupted when health emergencies strike. By embedding rehabilitation in emergency preparedness and response, people receive better care and individuals, families, and communities are better supported.

    "text": "Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children globally. It is transmitted through the oral-faecal route, directly from person to person, or indirectly through contaminated objects. People that are infected experience an abrupt onset of fever and vomiting followed by explosive, watery diarrhoea. Rotavirus diarrhoea is profuse, often leading to dehydration which can be severe, requiring hospitalization. The cornerstones of treatment of severe rotavirus diarrhoea are fluid replacement and zinc supplementation. Vaccines against rotavirus are available and vaccination is an important measure to reduce severe rotavirus-associated diarrhoea and mortality. Rotavirus causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting and severe dehydration in young children. Rotavirus diarrhoea is ubiquitous and, unlike bacterial diarrhoea, is not more prevalent in settings with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. Rotavirus peaks in cool, dry seasons in temperate climates but exhibits less pronounced seasonality in tropical settings. The clinical spectrum of rotavirus disease is wide, ranging from transient loose stools to severe diarrhoea and vomiting causing dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, shock, and death if rehydration is not provided. In typical cases, following an incubation period of 1–3 days, the onset of disease is abrupt, with fever and vomiting followed by watery diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal symptoms normally resolve within 3–7 days but may last for up to 2–3 weeks. Rotavirus has a case-fatality rate of approximately 2.5% among children in low-income countries who present to health facilities. This rate is higher in areas without good access to health care. WHO prequalified rotavirus vaccines have been available from 2008 and there are currently four vaccines available. They are all live, oral vaccines. RotaTeq, Rotavac, and ROTASIIL should be administered in a 3-dose schedule, while a 2-dose schedule should be used for Rotarix. A minimum interval of 4 weeks should be maintained between doses. WHO recommends that rotavirus vaccines should be included in all national immunization programmes and considered a priority, particularly in countries with high rotavirus gastroenteritis-associated fatality rates, such as in South and South-eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

    "text": "Human scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The microscopic mite burrows into the skin and lays eggs, eventually triggering a host immune response that leads to intense itching and rash. Scabies occurs worldwide. However, it is the most vulnerable groups - young children and the elderly in resource-poor communities - who are especially susceptible to scabies and the secondary complications of infestation. The highest rates of infestation occur in countries with hot, tropical climates, especially in communities where overcrowding and poverty coexist, and where there is limited access to treatment. The most serious complications of the disease are rheumatic heart disease, sepsis, and kidney disease. Countries in the Western Pacific Region where the populations (nearly approximately 26.6 million) are at high risk include American Samoa, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Populations in some areas (for instance indigenous populations in Australia) of other countries are also at a lower risk. These countries include Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Brunei. The highest burden is Papua New Guinea where all the provinces are endemic. The disease is believed to be prevalent in other countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as Lao People's Democratic Republic) but the lack of proper mapping makes it challenging to understand the scale of the prevalence in these countries. As such, the major challenge facing scabies is the availability and quality of data on disease burden estimates. Sufficient evidence is available showing that mass drug administration with ivermectin can significantly suppress the burden of the disease to very low levels. Symptoms of scabies usually begin 4–6 weeks after infestation. Sometimes there are visible signs before symptoms begin. Symptoms of scabies include: Severe itch, often worse at night; Itchy lines (linear burrows) and bumps (papules) on the fingers, wrists, arms, legs and belt area; Enflamed bumps on male genitalia and female breasts; and Larger rash in infants and small children, including on the palms, soles of the feet, ankles, and scalp. Most individuals are infected with 10–15 mites. People with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) sc",

Most individuals are infected with 10–15 mites. People with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) scabies. This severe infection can have thousands or millions of mites and causes dry, scaly areas on the skin. It often does not cause itch. Crusted scabies spread very easily and can cause secondary infections. It is life-threatening. Scabies mites burrow into the top layer of skin, where the adult female lays eggs. The eggs hatch in 3–4 days and develop into adult mites in 1–2 weeks. After 4–6 weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction to the presence of mite proteins and faeces in the scabies burrow, causing intense itch and rash. Mite effects on immunity, as well as the direct effects of scratching, can lead to inoculation of the skin with bacteria, leading to the development of impetigo (skin sores), especially in the tropics. Impetigo may become complicated by deeper skin infection such as abscesses or serious invasive diseases, including septicemia. Scabies can be treated with topical creams or oral medication in more severe cases. Itchiness often gets worse for 1–2 weeks after treatment starts. Topical treatments that are applied to the whole body include: 5% permethrin cream 0.5% malathion in aqueous base 10–25% benzyl benzoate emulsion 5–10% sulphur ointment. Ivermectin taken orally is also highly effective, but it should not be taken by pregnant women or children who weigh less than 15 kg. Treatments do not kill the parasite’s eggs, and treatment should be repeated to kill newly hatched mites. People do not experience symptoms in the early stages of infestation. To reduce spread, all people in the household should be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. Other treatments may be needed to treat the complications of scabies.

    "text": "Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematode worms). Humans are infected when larval forms of the parasite penetrate the skin during contact with infested water. Schistosomiasis mostly affects poor and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing populations. Inadequate hygiene and contact with infected water make children especially vulnerable to infection. In the Western Pacific Region, intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum is endemic in China and the Philippines, and that caused by Schistosoma mekongi is endemic in two provinces in Cambodia and one province in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases. Elimination of schistosomiasis in the Region is targeted through community empowerment with the One Health approach, composed of health promotion, improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), preventive chemotherapy campaigns, treatment and management of domestic animals and livestock, and focal snail control. Community-led initiatives on WASH called Community-Led Initiative to Elimination Schistosomiasis through WASH-NTD collaboration (CL-SWASH), are being implemented in Cambodia and Lao PDR. Under CL-SWASH, communities voluntarily improve sanitation coverage in schistosomiasis-endemic communities, facilitated by WASH and neglected tropical disease teams. Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worms' eggs. Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases, there may also be enlargement of the spleen. The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva.

Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anemia, stunting, and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Praziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood. Schistosomiasis control has been successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries around the world. With the support of partners, it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is required in several countries. In the Western Pacific Region, the governments of China and Switzerland have pledged funding to support the interruption of transmission of the disease in both Cambodia and Lao PDR.

    "text": "There were an estimated 86 million new cases of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) in the Region in 2020. STIs can have serious reproductive health consequences, including infertility, mother-to-child transmission, adverse birth outcomes including stillbirths and newborn deaths, increased risk of HIV acquisition, and cancer. STIs are spread predominantly by sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some STIs can also be spread through non-sexual means, such as via blood or blood products, as well as from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. Common symptoms of STIs include vaginal discharge, urethral discharge or burning in men, genital ulcers, and abdominal pain. The majority of STIs have no symptoms.. Of the 8 most common STIs, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other 4 infections are caused by viruses and cannot be cured: hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV or herpes), HIV, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Symptoms or disease due to these viral infections can be reduced or modified through treatment. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs and HIV. Early diagnosis of STIs, among people with or without symptoms, offers the best opportunity for effective medical treatment and support, and for preventing further transmission. Vaccines can protect against hepatitis B and HPV. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women and nearly all cases of cervical cancer can be attributed to HPV infection. Chronic hepatitis B is a leading cause of liver cancer. HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis can be transmitted from infected mothers to their infants, causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, transmission of these infections can be prevented by simple and effective interventions, including the prevention of new infections among people of reproductive age, prevention of unintended pregnancies, antenatal screening, treatment of infected pregnant women, follow-up and vaccination of infants born to infected mothers. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. When present, common symptoms of STIs include: abnormal vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, genital ulcers and lumps, and lower abdominal pain.

Symptoms of specific STIs are: Gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection These STIs cause cervicitis in women, urethritis in men and extra-genital infections, including rectal and oropharyngeal manifestations. Common symptoms include vaginal or penile discharge and burning with urination. Infants of infected mothers can contract neonatal conjunctivitis (red eyes) due to exposure to the STIs during vaginal delivery. Rectal and pharyngeal infections can be asymptomatic. Syphilis Syphilis is often asymptomatic, when symptoms occur, primary syphilis presents as a solitary, painless ulcer. Secondary syphilis may manifest as generalized lesions affecting skin, mucous membranes and lymph-node including a classic rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Latent syphilis is asymptomatic and characterized by positive syphilis serology. Trichomoniasis The predominant symptoms include abnormal vaginal discharge with redness of the vulva, itching and painful intercourse. Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) HSV most commonly presents as painful sores, vesicles or ulcerations on the external genitalia and mouth. Symptomatic genital HSV is a lifelong condition that can be characterized by frequent symptomatic recurrences. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Generally asymptomatic, the chronic form of HTLV-1 can cause severe disease, including adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a progressive nervous system condition known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs.

For viral STIs (HIV, HSV and HTLV-1), the most effective medications available are antivirals or anti-cancer drugs (in the case of HTLV-1), that can modulate the course of the diseases, though they cannot cure these three diseases. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics used to treat STIs, in particular gonorrhoea, has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced successful treatment outcomes. Results from the current Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP) show trends of high rates of quinolone resistance, increasing azithromycin resistance and emerging resistance of extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The emergence of decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, together with established high-levels of resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make gonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism. AMR for other STIs, though less common, also exists, making prevention and prompt treatment critical. To adequately treat STIs it is important to take the appropriate antimicrobials, with the correct dose and duration for the specific STI to ensure adequate treatment or cure, and to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

    "text": "Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening disease that typically results from the injection of a mixture of different toxins (“venom”) following the bite of a venomous snake. Envenoming can also be caused by having venom sprayed into the eyes by certain species of snakes that have the ability to spit venom as a defence measure. Snake antivenoms are effective treatments to prevent or reverse most of the harmful effects of snakebite envenoming and are included in the WHO list of essential medicines. Most deaths and serious consequences from snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible, and raising awareness on primary prevention among communities and health workers. The snake species implicated in serious snakebite injury vary from region to region, a fact that increases the challenge of mitigating the burden of snakebite worldwide. Various species of venomous snakes are present in the Western Pacific with variations between and within countries. This diversity is partly attributable to biodiversity in the region. Throughout the rest of tropical Asia, a similar cohort of culprits occurs, and cobras (Naja ssp.), kraits (Bungarus ssp.) and Russell’s vipers (where they occur) are responsible for the lion’s share of serious bites. In Papua New Guinea, the taipan ( Oxyuranus scutellatus ) is responsible for the most bites, followed by the death adders ( Acanthophis spp.). Both groups of snakes occur also in parts of Australia, but bites in that country are very rare. The two major challenges facing snakebite response in the Western Pacific Region include: 1) inadequate mapping of snakebite envenoming; and 2) availability of antivenoms. Bites or sprayed venom from venomous snakes can cause a range of acute and serious medical emergencies. Envenoming from different types of snakes can cause different symptoms, some more serious than others. This makes the preparation of correct antivenoms an ongoing problem. Envenoming can cause severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, making immediate medical attention critical. People may also experience bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhages or irreversible kidney failure. Severe local tissue destruction may also occur, which can lead to permanent disability and even limb amputation. Children are at higher risk of severe effects due to lower body mass than adults.

After a bite by a snake suspected of being venomous, follow these steps: Immediately move away from the area where the bite occurred. Remove anything tight from around the bitten part of the body to avoid harm if swelling occurs. Reassure the victim, as most venomous snake bites do not cause immediate death. Immobilize the person completely and transport the person to a health facility as soon as possible Applying pressure at the bite site with a pressure pad may be suitable in some cases. Avoid traditional first aid methods or herbal medicines. Paracetamol may be given for local pain (which can be severe). Vomiting may occur, so place the person on their left side in the recovery position. Closely monitor airway and breathing and be ready to resuscitate if necessary.

    "text": "In 2019, approximately 703 000 people died due to suicide globally, and 1 in 4 of these deaths occurred in the Western Pacific Region. Suicide is a major public health issue across a wide range of settings from highly developed to small Pacific island countries and areas. Suicide rates in some countries in the Western Pacific are among the highest in the world. The risk of suicide is particularly concerning among young people in Pacific island countries and areas. For every death due to suicide, there can be 20 times as many suicide attempts, creating lasting impacts among families and loved ones as well. If you are in crisis or know someone in danger of harming themselves, please contact your local emergency services. Suicides are preventable. LIVE LIFE, WHO’s approach to preventing suicide, outlines key actions towards developing a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. These include limiting access to means for suicide, interacting with media for responsible reporting of suicide, fostering socio-emotional life skills among adolescents, and early identification, assessment, management and follow-up of persons affected by suicidal behaviours. Additionally, it is critical to address factors that may increase the risk for poor mental health including, but not limited to, lack of access to care, economic insecurity, cultural norms, forced migration, social isolation and loneliness, stress, and climate change. Enhancing protective factors while reducing risk factors across the life course will contribute to preventing suicide. The new Regional Framework for the Future of Mental Health in the Western Pacific calls for a systems approach to promoting and protecting mental health, including the prevention of suicide. It envisions a Region where people enjoy the highest level of mental health and well-being, grounded in social solidarity for a transformative environment for mental health and well-being in the Western Pacific. The Framework identifies the following key strategies: 1) refocus the mental health agenda to include well-being and reaching the unreached through leadership that champions mental health for all; 2) transform mental health support and care into a community-based ecosystem of health and social services and innovations, enabled by a well-trained mental health workforce, delivering the full range of interventions, and underpinned by a responsive information system; and, 3) embed mental health into the settings and journeys of daily life by placing the well-being of communities at the centre and engaging partners within and beyond the health sector to help individuals, families and societies thrive and flourish. These strategies complement and are fully aligned with global goals and initiatives on preventing suicide. A series of technical resources",

    "text": "Adult tapeworms cause an intestinal infection called Taeniasis, of which Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) has a major impact on human health. Tapeworm eggs pass with the faeces and are infective for pigs. Humans can become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked, infected pork. Infection can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. While the adult tapeworm in the human intestine (taeniasis) does not have major health impacts cysticercosis can result in devastating effects on human health. The larvae may develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions, and epileptic seizures, and can be fatal. To prevent, control and possibly eliminate Taenia solium , proper public health interventions with an approach spanning veterinary, human health, and environmental sectors are required. Cysticercosis is a focal disease, affecting the poorest communities in which basic sanitation is deficient and pigs roam free. One of the first steps to control the disease is to identify those communities or endemic areas where control measures need to be implemented. WHO is assisting countries by providing protocols for mapping (identifying the endemic or high-risk areas), as well as assisting countries such as Cambodia in training diagnostic techniques that can be used for mapping. Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms associated with an intestinal infection (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, etc.). These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise, it may live for years. For cysticercosis, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions, infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin. Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia, and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous",

Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia, and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system. The treatment of taeniasis by Taenia solium is important to prevent neurocysticercosis and as a tool to assist in controlling or stopping the parasite transmission cycle. The treatment can be done on an individual bases, or as mass drug administration depending on the local circumstances and the control approaches being implemented. Taeniasis can be treated using anthelmintics (Praziquantel, Niclosamide, Albendazole) In neurocysticercosis, since the destruction of cysts may lead to an inflammatory response, specialized treatment of active disease is required and may include long courses with high doses of anthelmintic, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs, and possibly surgery. The dosage and the duration of treatment can vary greatly and depend mainly on the number, size, location, and developmental stage of the cysts, their surrounding inflammatory edema, acuteness, and severity of clinical symptoms or signs.

    "text": "Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body's muscles and nerves. It typically arises from a skin wound that becomes contaminated by a bacterium which is often found in soil. Symptoms usually begin 3 to 21 days after the infection, and include headache and muscular stiffness in the jaw, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, rigidity of abdominal muscles, spasms, sweating and fever. As the toxin produced by the bacteria circulates more widely, it interferes with the normal activity of nerves throughout the body, leading to generalized muscle spasms. Without treatment, tetanus can be fatal. Vaccination is the best way to protect against tetanus. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or in adults who have not kept up to date on their booster shots. Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from 3 to 21 days after tetanus bacteria enter the body through a wound. Most cases occur within 14 days. Symptoms can include: jaw cramping or the inability to open the mouth muscle spasms often in the back, abdomen and extremities sudden painful muscle spasms often triggered by sudden noises trouble swallowing seizures headache fever and sweating changes in blood pressure or fast heart rate In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborn’s inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying. Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. Tetanus requires treatment in a medical facility, often in a referral hospital. People who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again and therefore need to be immunized. Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV), which are included in routine immunization programmes globally and administered during antenatal care contacts. To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV. The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years of age, and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster",

    "text": "Tobacco use is one of the world's leading preventable causes of death and is a major preventable risk factor of noncommunicable diseases like cancer, lung and heart diseases. The most common type of tobacco product used is manufactured cigarettes, but tobacco is also used in many other forms. Tobacco kills up to half of its users, and more than 7 million people each year lose their lives as a result of direct tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke. Health impact The Western Pacific Region is home to an estimated 368 million adult smokers (aged 15+ years) and nearly half of adult men are current tobacco smokers. Tobacco kills more than 3 million people in the Region each year, including over 550 000 non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Tobacco is a major driver of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), causing or exacerbating cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and other NCDs. Socio-economic impact Tobacco use has direct and indirect impacts on the economy. Globally, the total economic cost of smoking from direct healthcare costs and productivity loss (from mortality and morbidity cause by smoking-attributable diseases) are estimated to be around US$ 1.4 trillion per year, equivalent to 1.8% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Most deaths related to tobacco occur among working-age individuals, and these deaths are largely preventable with effective tobacco control and cessation services in place. Environmental impact Tobacco harms the environment throughout its lifecycle, from cultivation, production, distribution, consumption and post-consumer waste. It destroys our forests, wastes our safe drinking water, and pollutes our air. The harmful impacts continue to grow adding unnecessary pressure to our planet’s already scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. In the Western Pacific Region an estimated 1.2 million tonnes of plastic from tobacco product waste is discarded annually. WHO supports countries and areas to strengthen tobacco control by: Developing and implementing comprehensive tobacco control policies and measures Addressing emerging challenges, including new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products including electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems Preventing and countering tobacco industry interference Strengthening multisectoral surveillance and evidence-based research to support tobacco control Engaging with tobacco control partners beyond the health sector The current Regional Action Plan for Tobacco Control in the Western Pacific (2020-2030) provides a focused strategy towards full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and provides guidance to successfully",

    "text": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world. It is caused by a bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis . The infection is transmitted through contact with eye and nose discharge of infected people, particularly young children who are the principal reservoir of infection. It is also spread by flies that have been in contact with the eyes and noses of infected people. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea. Blindness from trachoma is irreversible. Antibiotics can clear infection while maintaining facial cleanliness and improving access to water and sanitation are recommended preventative measures for endemic countries. In the Western Pacific Region, Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma remains endemic in four countries in the Region including Australia, Kiribati, Nauru, and Solomon Islands. Most of the endemic countries are implementing the SAFE strategy focusing on surgery, antibiotics, facial washing, and environmental improvement. Infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as “active trachoma”. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. After years of repeated episodes of active trachoma, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though the onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical. Women are blinded up to four times as often as men, probably due to more frequent contact with infected children. Individuals living in the poorest and most remote communities of Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Central and South America, and the Pacific islands are at risk. Trachoma can be prevented by limiting environmental risk",

Infections usually begin at an early age and grow less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infections are most often acquired through family and contact with others with active disease. Repeated infections cause the most serious symptoms of the disease. Trachoma can be eliminated as a public health problem using the SAFE strategy, comprising: Surgery to treat trachomatous trichiasis, the blinding stage of the disease; Antibiotics to clear the infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to national programmes through the International Trachoma Initiative; Facial cleanliness; and Environmental improvement, particularly better access to water and sanitation.

It is sometimes the only available and affordable option, especially in remote or under-served areas. Thus, it plays an important role in primary health care. Traditional and complementary medicine is a health practice with strong historical and cultural roots. Since it has often evolved as part of a particular cultural heritage, the forms of traditional medicine vary widely across the Region. Some forms are highly developed and well documented. They are based on systematized knowledge, comprehensive methodology and historical experience. A number of less complex traditional medicine practices also exist within small and sometimes isolated ethnic groups, based largely on local experience. The knowledge may not be documented, often being transmitted orally from generation to generation. In the Western Pacific Region, traditional and complementary medicine is used extensively for various health conditions, but its practice varies widely across different countries. Evidence over the years has shown the important role of traditional and complementary medicine in improving quality of life. In the context of the rapidly ageing population and an increase in noncommunicable diseases in the Region, the promotion and development of traditional and complementary medicine can help bring a shift from disease-oriented to person- and community-oriented approach to health. However, the availability of and access to traditional and complementary medicine vary across countries in the Region, and their evidence-based use is not fully optimized. WHO plays an important role in supporting Member States to harness the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being. To help improve the access to safe, effective and culturally accepted services, especially for populations that are hard to reach, WHO developed the Regional Framework for Harnessing the Role of Traditional and Complementary Medicine for Achieving Health and Well-being in the Western Pacific . The Regional Framework, developed in close collaboration with Member States, stakeholders, partners and experts, identifies four strategic actions and key action areas to achieve this vision, namely: promoting the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being in national policies; strengthening context-specific mechanisms to ensure safety, quality and effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine services; improving coverage and equitable access to traditional and complementary medicine services; and supporting documentation, research and innovation for traditional and complementary medicine services.

    "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the world’s top infectious killer. According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2024 , in 2023, the Western Pacific saw an estimated 1.9 million TB cases and 95 000 deaths. TB is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. About one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB infection, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. However, persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill. People with active TB can infect 10–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment, 45% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die. The good news is that TB is curable and preventable. Common symptoms of TB disease include: Prolonged cough Chest pain Weakness or fatigue Weight loss Fever Night sweats Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, thus leading to delays in seeking care and increasing the risk of spreading the infection to others. If a healthcare provider suspects a patient has TB disease, they will send the patient for testing. In the case of suspected lung TB disease, patients will be asked to give a sputum sample to test for TB bacteria. For non-lung TB disease, samples of affected body fluids and tissue can be tested. WHO recommends rapid molecular diagnostic tests as initial tests for people showing signs and symptoms of TB. With TB infection, a person gets infected with TB bacteria that lie inactive in the body. This infection can develop into TB disease if their immune system weakens. People with TB infection do not show any signs or symptoms of TB. To identify TB infection, healthcare providers will screen at-risk patients to rule out active TB, and they may use a skin or blood test to check for TB infection. TB disease is curable. It can be treated with a standard",

To identify TB infection, healthcare providers will screen at-risk patients to rule out active TB, and they may use a skin or blood test to check for TB infection. TB disease is curable. It can be treated with a standard 6-month course of 4 antibiotics. Common drugs include rifampicin and isoniazid. In some cases, the TB bacteria does not respond to the standard drugs. In this case, the patient has drug-resistant TB. Treatment for drug-resistant TB is longer and more complex. The course of TB drugs is provided to the patient with support by a health worker or trained volunteer. Without such support, treatment adherence can be difficult. If the treatment is not properly completed, the disease can become drug-resistant and can spread. In the case of TB infection (where the patient is infected with TB bacteria but not ill), TB preventive treatment can be given to stop the onset of disease. This treatment uses the same drugs for a shorter time. Recent treatment options have shortened the treatment duration to only 1 or 3 months, as compared to the previous 6-month regimen.

    "text": "Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all people and communities receive quality health services when and where they need them without suffering financial hardship. It covers the full spectrum of health services throughout the life-course, from promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. UHC requires strong and resilient health systems based on primary health care approach, as well as working with communities and other sectors to address the determinants of health. Although there are broad principles, good practices, and strategic directions for UHC, there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach—each country chooses its own path and pace, based on the context, even beyond health—fiscal, public administration, political, and cultural factors. Progress is incremental and can be accelerated with sustained political commitment, smarter investments, continuous monitoring, learning and evaluation, and course corrections. UHC is the overarching target of the Sustainable Development Goal on Health (SDG 3), central to achieving the Triple Billion targets globally and the foundation for realizing the For the Future vision in the Western Pacific Region. Over the past decade, countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region have made significant health gains in service coverage and increased commitments to advance UHC through various policy and programme interventions. However, financial protection has decreased especially with the interrelated challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2015, the Regional Committee of the Western Pacific endorsed the action framework that can guide countries in developing their UHC roadmaps based on taking concrete actions for improving the five interrelated attributes of high-performing health systems—quality, efficiency, equity, accountability, as well as sustainability and resilience. This has been reinforced in regional agendas and subsequently highlighted in taking systems approach and bringing together various health agendas towards the shared goal of improving health for all. As a foundation for UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Achieving UHC is a WHO strategic priority, with the goal of 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage by 2025. In countries with fragile health systems, we focus on technical assistance to build national institutions and service delivery to fill critical gaps in emergencies. In more robust health system settings, we drive public health impact towards health coverage for all through policy dialogue for the systems of the future and strategic support to improve performance.

This work is supported by normative guidance and agreements; data, research and innovation; and leadership in the realms of diplomacy, advocacy, gender equality, health equity and human rights, multisectoral action, and finance. UHC is one of the targets that all UN Member States committed to achieving by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). UHC is not only an overarching target but also provides a unifying agenda for overall progress on SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being for all at all ages”. This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health services, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Globally, the UHC service coverage index (SCI) increased from 45 in 2000 to 68 in 2021, however the world has seen a stagnating pace of progress in recent years and no change since 2019, depriving millions of people of lifesaving and health-enhancing interventions. In the Western Pacific Region, UHC SCI increased from 49 to 79 during the same period. While there is improvement in coverage of essential services, financial protection declined as the percentage of households with catastrophic health expenditure increased from 9.8% to 19.8% in 2019. It is imperative to note that UHC progress across and within the countries in the Region considerably varies given the diversity of countries and shifting health demands. Regional averages can, however, mask actual variations across countries and areas, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO has a range of evidence-informed approaches, strategies, and tools to support countries get back on track towards the progressive realization of UHC and broader sustainable development goals.

    "text": "For over two centuries, vaccines have helped make the world safe—from the very first vaccine developed to protect against smallpox to the newest mRNA vaccines used to prevent severe cases of COVID-19. Every year, vaccines save millions of lives. Vaccines are available to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people live longer, healthier lives. They reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. Though immunization is widely recognized as one of the most successful and widespread tools we have to protect against vaccine-preventable diseases, not everyone has the same access to them. In the Western Pacific Region, nearly a million children missed out on basic vaccines through routine immunization services in 2023, the majority never receiving a single vaccine dose. Countries and areas in the Western Pacific continue to introduce new vaccinations for people of all ages. Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications. Vaccines protect against many different diseases, including: cervical cancer cholera COVID-19 diphtheria hepatitis B influenza Japanese encephalitis malaria measles meningitis mumps Pertussis pneumonia polio rabies rotavirus rubella tetanus typhoid varicella yellow fever Not all these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family. Progress has been made in the Region towards the control, elimination and eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases. As of 2024, eight countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region have achieved measles elimination, seven have achieved rubella elimination, 26 have successfully reduced chronic hepatitis B infection among children to <1%, and the Region has maintained polio-free status. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines were rapidly and safely rolled out, achieving high coverage in many countries and areas. Despite these successes, many people continue to be left behind by national immunization efforts.

    "text": "Interpersonal violence includes: Gender-based violence, including violence against women Intimate partner violence Sexual violence Abuse of older people Violence against children under age 18 and child maltreatment Youth violence Armed, criminal, and gang related violence. Interpersonal violence can directly contribute to injury, premature death and disability. It also contributes to a range of physical, sexual, reproductive, and emotional and mental health problems. Specific health-related impacts of violence on the individual include injury, suicide, or self-harm, chronic pain, unintended pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, anxiety, and other symptoms of trauma. Community well-being is impacted by violence. Populations living in communities with violence may be at increased risk of chronic stress and disease. Moreover, concerns about violence can prevent people from engaging in healthy behaviours like walking, bicycling or using recreational spaces. Responding to injuries as a result of violence also burdens emergency healthcare services. People’s health is shaped by the conditions in which they live, work, learn, play and age. Often people who are most vulnerable to interpersonal violence experience the greatest inequities. For instance, interpersonal violence is often prevalent in communities with economic instability, concentrated poverty, and limited housing; and the burden is most predominantly experienced by women, people who are LGBTQI+, children, and those who experience ethnic or racial discrimination. Violence not only costs countries billions of dollars in health care, law enforcement, and lost productivity globally each year, but it also undermines community well-being, gender equality, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Interpersonal violence is a violation of human rights and a pervasive public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased vulnerabilities to violence due to the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. In the Western Pacific Region, gender-based violence, such as sexual exploitation, most heavily burdens women and girls. An estimated 122 million girls and women aged 15-49 years in the Western Pacific having experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, mostly by someone they know.

This plan provides guidance on what Member States can do to prevent and respond to violence by strengthening health system leadership and governance; health service delivery and health workers’ capacity to respond to violence; prevention efforts led or supported by the health sector; and the evidence base by improving information collected through the health system. In collaboration with partner agencies, WHO has developed two frameworks focused on ending violence against women and violence against children: “ RESPECT Women: Preventing violence against women ” and “ INSPIRE: Seven strategies for ending violence against children \".

Preventable water-related diseases claim tens of thousands of lives in the Western Pacific Region. The Region made considerable progress from 1990 to 2018, with most countries achieving global targets for drinking-water and sanitation. Still, nearly 90 million people in the Region do not use a basic drinking-water facility and more than 400 million do not use a basic sanitation facility. Sufficient, affordable and safely managed drinking-water, sanitation, and improved hygiene behaviours can cut this number dramatically. In adopting the Sustainable Development Goals, the global community pledged to achieve universal coverage of safely managed drinking - water and sanitation services and to eradicate open defecation by 2030. Contaminated drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene are linked to the transmission of preventable diseases. This is true not only with the population in general but also particularly in healthcare facilities. Similarly, the inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater leads to major health hazards, due to direct exposure of humans to contamination or through microbial or chemical contamination of drinking watercourse. Globally, 1.4 million deaths and 74 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) could be prevented by access to clean water, adequate sanitation and proper hygiene. In 2019, more than 84 000 people died in the Western Pacific Region as a result of water-related diseases. Today, nearly 90 million individuals in the Western Pacific still lack access to safe drinking water facilities, and over 400 million people do not have access to basic sanitation services. Pacific island countries and areas, in particular, face significant challenges in terms of insufficient access to WASH resources. Climate change and water security are interconnected challenges that cannot be separated. The effects of climate change are evident in various aspects of water, including its availability, accessibility, quality, and stability. Every year, approximately 3.5 million deaths globally occur as a result of environmental-related factors, which include diseases transmitted through contaminated water. WHO in the Western Pacific works with Member States to improve access to safely managed drinking-water supply and sanitation, and good hygiene behaviours to protect health and well-being. WHO has been a major partner to relevant multilateral and bilateral agencies in the Region through organizing crucial high-level events and has facilitated important related international commitments.

The regional vision, For the Future , outlines ensuring good water, sanitation and hygiene management practice in health facilities as a key component to mitigate the impacts of climate and environmental change on the national health systems. This presents a high-level strategic framework for the development of actions to strengthen WASH services in health care facilities throughout the Region. WHO works with countries to achieve the target of all health facilities having access to safely managed WASH services in the Region. Unfortunately, information about the status of WASH in healthcare facilities in the countries of Western Pacific Region is greatly missing. Efforts are being made to capture all the data exist in the Region, as well as to embed indicators for WASH in healthcare facilities into existing health monitoring systems to better inform the status. Regional programmatic priorities also highlight on ensuring drinking water quality. WHO supports the establishment of water safety plans and household water treatment and safe storage in Member States. This includes developing national strategies and increasing the capacity on implementing safe drinking water programs based on WHO guidelines.

    "text": "Yaws is a chronic infectious disease, caused by the Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue , which affects the skin, bone and cartilage. If left untreated, it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. Transmission is through person-to-person contact of minor injuries. Poverty, low socio-economic conditions, and poor personal hygiene facilitate the spread of yaws. The disease is found primarily in poor communities in warm, humid, and tropical forest areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific. About 75 – 80% of people affected are children under 15 years of age. The discovery in 2012 that a single, oral dose of the antibiotic azithromycin can completely cure yaws has reopened the prospects of yaws eradication. Two countries in the Western Pacific Region, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, carry the heaviest burden of yaws in the world. In 2022, Papua New Guinea reported more than 96 000 clinical cases whereas Solomon Islands reported more than 12 000 cases. The two other countries endemic to yaws are Vanuatu and the Philippines. Vanuatu reported 690 clinical cases in 2022. The country is conducting integrated mass drug administrations to eliminate the disease. Reporting yaws cases from the Philippines is currently a challenge. There are two stages of yaws infection. The early stage is when the patient is infectious and can spread the disease to others. In this stage, a papule (a noncancerous, outward-growing lump) develops at the site of infection. This papule is full of organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Without treatment, this is followed by disseminated skin lesions over the body. Bone pain and bone lesions may also occur. The second stage is non-infectious and typically appears 5 years after infection. It is characterized by disabling consequences of the nose, bones, and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis (thickening). After a field diagnosis based on these symptoms, the disease can be confirmed by examining a sample from a skin legion under a special type of microscope (darkfield examination). Blood tests are not typically used because yaws is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis and the two diseases will show the same result. There is currently no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improved personal hygiene are the most important tactics for prevention.",

Young adolescents aged 10–14 years have the lowest risk of death among all age groups. Injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning), interpersonal violence, self-harm and maternal conditions are the leading causes of death among adolescents and young adults. Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 18, but most cases are undetected and untreated. Early onset of substance use is associated with higher risks of developing dependence and other problems during adult life, and younger people are disproportionately affected by substance use compared with older people. Globally, there were 42 births per 1000 to girls aged 15–19 years in 2021. Overview Survival chances for adolescents and young adults vary greatly across the world. In 2021, the average probability of a 10-year-old dying before age 24 was about 6 times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in North America and Europe. Within the age group 10–24 years, mortality rates are lowest among adolescents aged 10–14, and highest among young adults aged 20–24 years. Females generally have lower mortality rates for these ages than males. The patterns of death of 10–14-year-olds are dominated by infectious diseases. Among older adolescents and young adults, a shift away from infectious diseases of childhood is seen, towards accidents and injuries, self-harm and interpersonal violence. Sex differences in mortality rates also become apparent in adolescence. Main health issues Many unintentional injuries such as road traffic and drowning are the leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. Road traffic accidents In 2021, over 100 000 adolescents (10–19 years) died from road traffic accidents . Many of those who died were vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists or users of motorized two-wheelers.

Alcohol fact sheet Tobacco use The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Globally in 2018, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13–15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher. E-cigarettes are particularly risky when used by children and adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties. Tobacco fact sheet E-cigarettes: how risky are they? Mental health Depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is among the leading causes of death in people aged 15–19 years. Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 18, but most cases are undetected and untreated. Many factors have an impact on the well-being and mental health of adolescents. Violence, poverty, stigma, exclusion, and living in humanitarian and fragile settings can increase the risk of developing mental health problems.

Children and young adolescents aged under 15 years represent about 11% of all people with TB globally. This means 1.1 million children and young adolescents aged under 15 years fall ill with TB every year, and more than 225 000 of them lose their lives. Adolescents and young adults usually present with bacteriologically infectious TB characterized by cavities seen on chest x-rays. The Global Tuberculosis Report shows that notification rates in adolescents aged 15–19 years are relatively high compared with younger adolescents. Tuberculosis fact sheet Other infectious diseases Diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia) are estimated to be among the top five causes of death for adolescents 10–14 years, with mortality rates being particularly high in African low- and middle-income countries. Thanks to improved childhood vaccination, adolescent deaths and disability from measles have fallen markedly.

Early pregnancy and childbirth Approximately 12 million girls aged 15–19 years and at least 777 000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in developing regions. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are among the leading causes of death for girls aged 15–19 years globally. The global adolescent birth rate in 2021 was 42 births per 1000 girls this age, and country rates range from 1 to over 200 births per 1000 girls annually. This indicates a marked decrease since 1990. This decrease is reflected in a similar decline in maternal mortality rates among girls aged 15–19 years. One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, the world should ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Adolescent pregnancy fact sheet Environmental health Many of the main causes of mortality in adolescents and young adults have strong links to the environment, including unintentional injuries and infectious diseases. Young people are at increased risk of environmental hazards and pollution due to their developmental physiology and immature systems. Primary environmental hazards and pollution affecting the health of adolescents and young adults include air pollution, chemicals and heavy metals, climate change, UV radiation, urban health and WASH.

Malnutrition fact sheet Healthy diet fact sheet Physical activity Globally, in 2016, only 1 in 5 adolescents are estimated to meet WHO guidelines on physical activity. Prevalence of inactivity is high across all WHO regions, and higher in female as compared to male adolescents (8) . Physical activity fact sheet Rights of adolescents The rights of children under 18 years to survive, grow and develop are enshrined in international legal documents. In 2013, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) published guidelines on the right of children to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, and a General Comment on realizing the rights of children during adolescence was published in 2016. It highlights states’ obligations to recognize the special health and development needs and rights of young people. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) also sets out the rights of women and girls to health and adequate health care. WHO response WHO works with Member States and partners to improve the health of young people by producing evidence-based guidelines, advocating and providing recommendations for adolescent-responsive health systems, and documenting progress in adolescent health and development. In 2023, WHO published an update of the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!): Guidance to support country implementation . AA-HA! 2.0 has drawn on inputs received during consultations with Member States, United Nations agencies, adolescents and young people, civil society and other partners.

    "text": "Mental health of adolescents Key facts Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 15% of the global burden of disease in this age group. Depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among those aged 15–29 years old. The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults. Introduction One in six people are aged 10–19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood. Globally, it is estimated that one in seven (14.3%) of 10–19-year-olds experience mental health conditions (1) , yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. Adolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations. Mental health determinants Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important. Multiple factors affect mental health. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity between an adolescent’s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other important determinants include the quality of their home life and relationships with peers. Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health. Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual",

Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups. Emotional disorders Emotional disorders are common among adolescents. Anxiety disorders (which may involve panic or excessive worry) are the most prevalent in this age group and are more common among older than among younger adolescents. It is estimated that 4.1% of 10–14-year-olds and 5.3% of 15–19-year-olds experience an anxiety disorder (1) . Depression is estimated to occur among 1.3% of adolescents aged 10–14 years, and 3.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Depression and anxiety share some of the same symptoms, including rapid and unexpected changes in mood. Anxiety and depressive disorders can profoundly affect school attendance and schoolwork. Social withdrawal can exacerbate isolation and loneliness. Depression can lead to suicide. Behavioural disorders Behavioural disorders are more common among younger adolescents than older adolescents. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by difficulty paying attention and/or excessive activity and acting without regard to consequences, occurs among 2.7% of 10–14-year-olds and 2.2% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Conduct disorder (involving symptoms of destructive or challenging behaviour) occurs among 3.3% of 10–14-year-olds and 1.8% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Behavioural disorders can affect adolescents’ education and increases the risk of criminal behaviour. Eating disorders Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food, accompanied in most instances by concerns about body weight and shape. Girls are more commonly affected than boys.

Eating disorders Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food, accompanied in most instances by concerns about body weight and shape. Girls are more commonly affected than boys. Eating disorders can affect physical health and often co-exist with depression, anxiety and substance use disorders. They occur in an estimated 0.1% of 10–14-year-olds and 0.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1). They are associated with suicide. Anorexia nervosa can lead to premature death, often due to medical complications or suicide, and has higher mortality than any other mental disorder. Psychosis Conditions that include symptoms of psychosis most commonly emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can include hallucinations or delusions. These experiences can impair an adolescent’s ability to participate in daily life and education and often lead to stigma or human rights violations. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Suicide and self-harm Suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents and young adults (15–29 years) (2) . Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, and include harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma against help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to means of suicide. Digital media, like any other media, can play a significant role in either enhancing or weakening suicide prevention efforts. Risk-taking behaviours Many risk-taking behaviours for health, such as substance use or sexual risk-taking, start during adolescence. Risk-taking behaviours can be an unhelpful strategy to cope with emotional difficulties and can severely impact an adolescent’s mental and physical well-being. Young people are especially vulnerable to developing harmful substance use patterns that can persist across the lifespan. In 2019, the prevalence of alcohol use among 15–19-year-olds was high worldwide (22%) with very few gender differences, and showing an increase in consumption in some regions (3). The use of tobacco and cannabis are additional concerns. Many adult smokers had their first cigarette prior to the age of 18 years.

In 2022, the prevalence of cannabis use among adolescents was higher than that of adults globally (5.5 per cent compared with 4.4 per cent, respectively) (4). Perpetration of violence is a risk-taking behaviour that can increase the likelihood of low educational attainment, injury, involvement with crime or death. Interpersonal violence was ranked among the leading causes of death of older adolescents in 2021 (1) . Promotion and prevention Mental health promotion and prevention interventions aim to strengthen an individual's capacity to regulate emotions, enhance alternatives to risk-taking behaviours, build resilience for managing difficult situations and adversity, and promote supportive social environments and social networks. These programmes require a multi-level approach with varied delivery platforms – for example, digital media, health or social care settings, schools or the community – and varied strategies to reach adolescents, particularly the most vulnerable. Early detection and treatment It is crucial to address the needs of adolescents with mental health conditions. Avoiding institutionalization and over-medicalization, prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches, and respecting the rights of children in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments are key for adolescents’ mental health. WHO response WHO works on strategies, programmes and tools to assist governments in responding to the health needs of adolescents. For example, the Helping Adolescents Thrive (HAT) Initiative is a joint WHO-UNICEF effort to strengthen policies and programmes for the mental health of adolescents. More specifically, the efforts made through the Initiative are to promote mental health and prevent mental health conditions. They are also intended to help prevent self-harm and other risk behaviours, such as harmful use of alcohol and drugs, that have a negative impact on the mental – and physical – health of young people. WHO has also developed a module on Child and Adolescent Mental and Behavioural Disorders as part of the mhGAP Intervention Guide 2.0.

    "text": "Adolescent pregnancy Key facts As of 2019, adolescents aged 15–19 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had an estimated 21 million pregnancies each year, of which approximately 50% were unintended and which resulted in an estimated 12 million births (1,2) . Based on 2019 data, 55% of unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years end in abortions, which are often unsafe in LMICs (1) . Adolescent mothers (aged 10–19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than women aged 20–24 years, and babies of adolescent mothers face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and severe neonatal condition. Data on childbirths among girls aged 10–14 are getting more widely available. Globally the adolescent birth rate for girls 10–14 years in 2023 was estimated at 1.5 per 1000 women with higher rates in sub-Saharan Africa (4.4) and Latin America and the Caribbean (2.3) (3). Preventing pregnancy among adolescents and pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity are foundational to achieving positive health outcomes across the life course and imperative for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to maternal and newborn health. Overview Adolescent pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social and economic consequences. Globally, the adolescent birth rate (ABR) has decreased, but rates of change have been uneven across regions. There are also enormous variations in levels between and within countries. Adolescent pregnancy tends to be higher among those with less education or of low economic status. Further, there is slower progress in reducing adolescent first births amongst these and other vulnerable groups, leading to increasing inequity. Child marriage and child sexual abuse place girls at increased risk of pregnancy, often unintended. In many places, barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding unintended pregnancies. There is growing attention being paid to improving access to quality maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. WHO works with partners to advocate for attention to adolescent pregnancy, to build an evidence base for action, to develop policy and programme support tools, to build capacity and to support countries to address adolescent pregnancy effectively.

Scope of the problem Every year, an estimated 21 million girls aged 15–19 years in developing regions become pregnant and approximately 12 million of them give birth (1) . Globally, ABR has decreased from 64.5 births per 1000 women (15–19 years) in 2000 to 41.3 births per 1000 women in 2023. However, rates of change have been uneven in different regions of the world with the sharpest decline in Southern Asia (SA), and slower declines in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions. Although declines have occurred in all regions, SSA and LAC continue have the highest rates globally at 97.9 and 51.4 births per 1000 women, respectively, in 2023 (3). There are enormous differences within regions in ABR as well. In the WHO African Region, the estimated ABR was 97 per 1000 adolescent in 2023 compared to 13.1 per 1000 adolescent girls in the European Region (3). Even within countries, there are enormous variations, for example in Zambia the percentage of adolescent girls aged 15–19 who have begun childbearing (women who either have had a birth or are pregnant at the time of interview) ranged from 14.9% in Lusaka to 42.5% in the Southern Province in 2018 (4). In the Philippines, this ranged from 3.5% in the Cordillera Administrative Region to 17.9% in the Davao Peninsula Region in 2017 (5). While the estimated global ABR has declined, the actual number of childbirths to adolescents continues to be high. The largest number of estimated births to 15–19-year-olds in 2021 occurred in SSA (6 114 000), whereas far fewer births occurred in Central Asia (68 000).

The corresponding number was 332 000 among adolescents aged 10–14 years in SSA, compared to 22 000 in South-East Asia (SEA) in the same year (3) . Context in which adolescent pregnancies occur Studies of risk and protective factors related to adolescent pregnancy in LMICs indicate that levels tend to be higher among those with less education or of low economic status (6). Progress in reducing adolescent first births has been particularly slow amongst these vulnerable groups, leading to increasing inequity. Several factors contribute to adolescent pregnancies and births. First, in many societies, girls are under pressure to marry and bear children. As of 2021, the estimated global number of child brides was 650 million : child marriage places girls at increased risk of pregnancy because girls who are married very early typically have limited autonomy to influence decision-making about delaying child-bearing and contraceptive use. Second, in many places, girls choose to become pregnant because they have limited educational and employment prospects and motherhood is valued. Contraceptives are not easily accessible to adolescents in many places. Even when adolescents can obtain contraceptives, they may lack the agency or the resources to pay for them, knowledge on where to obtain them and how to correctly use them. They may face stigma when trying to obtain contraceptives. Further, they are often at higher risk of discontinuing use due to side effects, and due to changing life circumstances and reproductive intentions . Restrictive laws and policies regarding the provision of contraceptives based on age or marital status pose an important barrier to the provision and uptake of contraceptives among adolescents. This is often combined with health worker bias and/or lack of willingness to acknowledge adolescents’ sexual health needs. Child sexual abuse increases the risk of unintended pregnancies. A WHO report published in 2021 estimates that 120 million girls aged under 20 years were subjected to sexual violence by someone other than a partner. This abuse is deeply rooted in gender inequality; it affects more girls than boys, although many boys are also affected . Estimates suggest that in 2020 , at least 1 in 8 of the world’s children",

This abuse is deeply rooted in gender inequality; it affects more girls than boys, although many boys are also affected . Estimates suggest that in 2020 , at least 1 in 8 of the world’s children had been sexually abused before reaching the age of 18, and 1 in 20 girls aged 15–19 years had experienced forced sex during their lifetime. The WHO report titled Violence against women prevalence estimates 2018 notes that “adolescents aged 15–19 years (24%) are estimated to have already been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner at least once in their lifetime, and 16% of adolescent girls and young women aged 15–19 have been subjected to this violence within the past 12 months.” Preventing adolescent pregnancy and childbearing as well as child marriage is part of the SDG agenda with dedicated indicators, including indicator 3.7.2, “Adolescent birth rate (aged 10–14 years; aged 15–19 years) per 1000 women in that age group,” and 5.3.1, “Proportion of women aged 20–24 years married before the age of 18 years.” Strategies and interventions related to adolescent pregnancy have focused on pregnancy prevention. However, there is growing attention being paid to improving access to and quality of maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. Available data on access paints a mixed picture. Access to quality care depends on the geographic context and the social status of adolescents. Even where access is not limited, adolescents appear to receive a lower quality of both clinical care and interpersonal support than adult women do. WHO response WHO works with partners to advocate for attention to adolescents, build the evidence and epidemiologic base for action, develop and test programme support tools, build capacity, and pilot initiatives in the small but growing number of countries that recognize the need to address adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health.

    "text": "Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth. This affects how they feel, think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. Despite being thought of as a healthy stage of life, there is significant death, illness and injury in the adolescent years. Much of this is preventable or treatable. During this phase, adolescents establish patterns of behaviour – for instance, related to diet, physical activity, substance use, and sexual activity – that can protect their health and the health of others around them, or put their health at risk now and in the future. To grow and develop in good health, adolescents need information, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; opportunities to develop life skills; health services that are acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective; and safe and supportive environments. They also need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery of interventions to improve and maintain their health. Expanding such opportunities is key to responding to adolescents’ specific needs and rights. There are more adolescents in the world than ever before: 1.3 billion, totalling one sixth of the global population. This number is expected to rise through 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where close to 90% of 10- to 19-year-olds live. An estimated 1.1 million adolescents die each year. The leading causes are road traffic injuries, suicide and interpersonal violence. Millions of adolescents also experience illness and injury. Causes of mortality and morbidity among adolescents differ by sex and age, and also by geographic region. For 10-14-year-olds, the leading risks for health are related to water, hygiene and sanitation. Risks for 15-19-year-olds are more often related to behaviours, such as alcohol use and unsafe sex. Poor diet and low physical activity are additional challenges which begin in childhood and adolescence, as does sexual abuse. Older adolescent girls are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence. Pregnancy complications and unsafe abortions are the leading causes of death among 15-19-year-old girls. Most adolescent mortality and morbidity is preventable or treatable, but adolescents face specific barriers in accessing health information and services. Restrictive laws and policies, parental or partner control, limited knowledge, distance, cost, lack",

Older adolescent girls are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence. Pregnancy complications and unsafe abortions are the leading causes of death among 15-19-year-old girls. Most adolescent mortality and morbidity is preventable or treatable, but adolescents face specific barriers in accessing health information and services. Restrictive laws and policies, parental or partner control, limited knowledge, distance, cost, lack of confidentiality, and provider bias can all restrict adolescents from getting the care they need to grow and develop in good health. WHO supports countries to ensure that their national adolescent health responses are evidence-based and take account of the values and preferences of adolescents. Improving the evidence base on adolescent health is crucial. WHO supports countries to improve measurement and strengthen data, conducts research, and shares best practice. WHO issues evidence-based recommendations that are relevant for – or specific to – adolescents across the full range of health areas including: positive development, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health including HIV, unintentional injury, violence, and mental health, substance abuse and self-harm. To support the implementation of these recommendations, WHO produces a range of policy and programme support tools. At the heart is the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) , which guides national-level policy-makers and programme managers on how to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate adolescent health programmes. WHO also supports countries to scale up efforts in service delivery, financing and governance, helps to build the capacities of national-level researchers and programmers, and provides technical support for policy and programmes.

Mental health promotion involves actions to strengthen the policy environment and the use of strategic communication for network building, stakeholder engagement, enhanced mental health literacy, and behavior change. Mental health promotion interventions improve overall wellbeing and are delivered in the settings where people live, work, learn, and thrive. These include school and workplace mental health programs, early childhood interventions, social support and community engagement, women empowerment, anti-discrimination programs, and other interventions that address the social determinants of mental health. In order to maximize impact, mental health promotion activities must be linked closely with mental health services, and engage a variety of health and non-health (e.g. education, labour, social welfare, justice, environment, etc.) sectors. WHO also leads high-profile advocacy campaigns to mobilize partners and resources, whilst raising awareness among decision makers and the general public. These include annual advocacy days on mental health, suicide prevention, and dementia, and other special initiatives.

    "text": "A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and other conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and wholegrains. Diet can depend on an individual’s food choices, but also the availability and affordability of healthy foods and sociocultural factors. Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment requires involvement across multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government, the public and the private sector. Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to easily adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by policy-makers include: Coordinating trade, food system and agricultural policies with the protection and promotion of public health; Encouraging consumers’ demand for healthy foods and meals; and Promoting healthy nutrition across the life course. The WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was adopted in 2004 by the World Health Assembly. It called on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at global, regional and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity. WHO Member States have also agreed to reduce the global population’s intake of salt by 30% by 2025; and to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents as well as in childhood overweight by 2025.

It is estimated that 84% of newborn deaths due to infection could be averted through early diagnosis and appropriate clinical management. However, diagnostic tests for serious bacterial infection, including bacterial sepsis, among infants are either inadequate or entirely lacking in many settings. The WHO target product profile for in vitro diagnostic tests for serious bacterial infection, including neonatal sepsis, among young infants aims to guide manufacturers, regulators and implementers in developing accessible, affordable tools that improve clinical decision-making, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and save lives, especially in low-resource settings where the burden of neonatal sepsis remains critical. Designed for both hospital and non-hospital settings, the target product profile defines the essential and desirable characteristics of tests to support early, accurate diagnosis among infants aged 0–59 days.",

New HIV infections have risen by 8% and AIDS-related deaths by 10% since 2019, highlighting critical gaps in prevention, testing, treatment and care services, particularly for key populations, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While 76% of people living with HIV in the Region have access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART), experts agree that these disturbing trends show that much more needs to be done to stop the spread of HIV and prevent avoidable deaths. Every hour, 16 people are newly infected, and six people die from HIV-related causes in the Western Pacific Region. While other WHO regions have made notable progress in curbing new infections, the Western Pacific Region still faces significant challenges, with 2.3 million people living with HIV, 140 000 new infections and 53 000 deaths in 2023 alone. There are 19 000 children living with HIV in the Region, but only two out of three of them are on ART. Globally in 2023, there were 39.9 million people with HIV; 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes; and another 1.3 million people acquired the virus. Surging new infections The epidemic continues to disproportionately affect key populations, including men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, female sex workers, people who inject drugs and their partners. Between 2010 and 2022, new HIV infections among these groups surged by as much as 85%, highlighting persistent inequities that demand immediate attention. Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, emphasized the urgency of addressing these challenges: “The rising HIV infections and deaths in the Western Pacific Region are a wake-up call. We must urgently address the barriers that prevent people — especially those in key populations and their partners — from accessing prevention, treatment and care.” “Achieving universal health coverage and protecting the right to health are critical to reversing these worrying trends and ensuring that the services are reaching everyone, including the most underserved populations,” he noted.

HIV transmission can be prevented. In the Western Pacific Region, domestic funding for HIV response has grown and now surpasses external aid. Effective tools – such as condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and needle and syringe programmes – as well as life-saving treatments such as ART are available. In addition, people taking ART who achieve an undetectable viral load not only prevent the virus from passing to sexual partners, but also can lead long, healthy and productive lives. But these efforts remain underfunded. Inadequate stocks of diagnostics and drugs, along with stigma and discrimination, further hinder progress. Closing these gaps is essential to reduce new infections and ensure equitable access to high-quality prevention and treatment services for all. Illuminating the “right” path Ahead of World AIDS Day on 1 December, WHO calls on governments and communities across the Region to allocate adequate resources to strengthen and sustain HIV services. Integrating HIV prevention, treatment and care within primary health-care systems is critical to improving the accessibility and resilience of these services. This year’s theme – Take the Right Path: My Health, My Right – highlights the critical role of human rights in breaking down barriers to HIV services. Empowering individuals with access to prevention, education and care not only improves their health, but also upholds their fundamental rights. Ensuring equal access is essential for stopping new infections and enabling people living with HIV to lead long, healthy and fulfilling lives. ______________________________________ For more information, please contact: WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific Communications Unit Email: wprocom@who.int Related HIV/AIDS in the Western Pacific World AIDS Day 2024 Feature stories",

    "text": "WHO urges governments to stop subsidizing life-threatening tobacco crops MANILA – To mark World No Tobacco Day on 31 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) urges governments to stop subsidizing tobacco farming and support more sustainable crops that could feed millions. “Tobacco is used by more than 400 million people in the Western Pacific Region, and every year, 3 million of them are killed by this deadly product,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Acting Regional Director for the Western Pacific. “When governments continue to prioritize business over health, ecosystems will be lost; people will go hungry; and health will decline.” Millions of people in the Western Pacific face food insecurity. Meanwhile, more than 1 million hectares of land in the Region are used to grow tobacco. If this land were used to grow food instead, about 60 000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables could be grown, providing the recommended daily intake for more than 400 000 people a year. Or roughly 243 000 tonnes of rice could be produced, which would feed more than 3 million people a year. Seven of the world’s top 50 tobacco growing countries are located in the Region: Cambodia, China, Japan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. Tobacco farming exposes farmers and their families to toxic tobacco dust and chemical pesticides. Additionally, the environment suffers due to deforestation, contamination of water sources and degradation of soil. A new WHO report entitled “Grow food, not tobacco” highlights the ills of tobacco growing and the benefits of switching to more sustainable food crops for farmers, communities, economies, the environment and the world at large. The report also exposes how the tobacco industry traps farmers in a vicious cycle of debt, propagating tobacco growing by exaggerating its economic benefits and lobbying through farming front groups. Tobacco farming causes diseases to the farmers and more than 1 million child laborers around the world estimated to be working on tobacco farms and missing out on education. “Imagine if we used the same 1 million hectares to grow nutritious food. We could nourish millions of people, help children grow and develop, and support adults to reach their full potential,” said Dr Jakab. “It’s time to grow food, not tobacco.” Tobacco growing is a global problem. Trees cut down for tobacco farming make up 5% of global deforestation – an area roughly the size of Samoa disappears every year. Experiences",

Trees cut down for tobacco farming make up 5% of global deforestation – an area roughly the size of Samoa disappears every year. Experiences from countries in the Region such as Cambodia, Malaysia and the Philippines, have demonstrated that tobacco growers can shift from tobacco to economically viable alternative crops — such as vegetables, peanuts and mung beans—with appropriate government support and interventions. Today, all Western Pacific countries are parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). They are committed to “promote economically “promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers and growers.” alternatives for tobacco workers and growers.” Ending subsidies for tobacco growing and supporting healthier crops would help countries fulfil that commitment. By choosing to grow food instead of tobacco, countries can prioritize health, preserve ecosystems and increase food security. Every year on World No Tobacco Day, people and institutions are honoured for making a difference in tobacco control. This year, five awardees in the Western Pacific Region are being recognized for exceptional contributions to tobacco control: The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of Cambodia; The Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Revenue and Customs Services, and the Police Force of Fiji; The Cultural and Social Committee of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic; Senator Pilar Juliana “Pia” Schramm Cayetano of the Philippines; and the Ministry of Health of Vanuatu.

    "text": "WHO turns 75: People live 30 years longer, but more action needed to ensure health for all and prepare for future threats Emergencies, climate change and noncommunicable diseases loom as threats to health. MANILA – Public health achievements over the past 75 years have extended life for people in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region by at least three decades. Yet too many are left behind, and looming threats still challenge decades of health gains, says WHO on its 75 th anniversary. When WHO was created after the Second World War, people in the countries and areas of the Western Pacific had a life expectancy of between 40 and 50 years. In some parts of the Region, up to half of the infants born never saw their first birthday. Care in many places was limited to emergency treatment, as there were too few health workers – an issue that persists until today in some parts of the Region. In 1948, smallpox and polio were major threats. Malaria was widespread. And neglected tropical diseases, such as yaws, were important public health problems. Hunger, nutritional deficiencies and poor access to safe water and sanitation further harmed people’s health and their potential as individuals, communities and societies. Extending healthy life in the Western Pacific Today, the people of the Western Pacific live for 77 years on average, thanks to public health investments and innovations. “For 75 years, WHO has been working hand-in-hand with countries and partners to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable, so all people can attain the highest level of health and well-being,” says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Acting Regional Director for the Western Pacific. “Now is the time to celebrate past achievements, build upon them and do more to extend the quality of people’s lives across the Western Pacific.” Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and the Region has been free of wild poliovirus transmission since 2000. Over the past two decades, malaria deaths in the Western Pacific have decreased by 88%. Several countries have eliminated or nearly eliminated the disease, as well as others including rubella (a virus that causes birth defects when pregnant women are infected), lymphatic filariasis (a disease caused by parasitic worms, commonly known as elephantiasis) and trachoma (an infection that causes blindness). Across the Region, advances in the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene have",

Across the Region, advances in the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene have contributed to a 60% reduction since 2000 in deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases. Primary health care has brought many services closer to communities. Today in the Region, more mothers and children are surviving and thriving. Nearly all births are supported by skilled health professionals, and life-saving vaccinations now reach 90% of children. Breastfeeding is also better protected and supported, with 15 countries in the Region having laws based on The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes . Over the past four decades, as the burden in the Region of some infectious diseases eased while the impact of chronic diseases grew, WHO has increased health promotion efforts to protect people from harmful risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. In Pacific island countries and areas, adoption of the Yanuca Island Declaration in 1995 resulted in the Healthy Islands vision to promote and protect health across sectors. This vision has helped shape the approach to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by supporting a focus on the environments in which people are nurtured, work and play. The world’s first public health treaty was the 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Today, countries and areas across the Western Pacific have implemented FCTC measures to protect present and future generations from the devastating impacts of tobacco use. In 2011, Australia became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging, paving the way for other countries to take more aggressive steps to regulate the promotion of tobacco products. From outbreaks of cholera and avian flu to SARS and COVID-19, WHO has supported countries to prepare for and respond to major health emergencies. In 2003 in the Western Pacific, SARS became the first international outbreak in which information about a new disease was gathered and made public in real time.

This information improved the ability of WHO, countries and partners to quickly move people, resources and supplies to where they were needed most. Lessons from outbreaks have been identified and utilized to continuously strengthen health security in this Region, including three iterations of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies . When COVID-19 emerged, WHO supported countries and areas to respond quickly and strategically. These efforts have contributed to relatively low mortality rates and high vaccination coverage in the Region, particularly among health workers and other vulnerable populations. More to do to achieve health for all The WHO Constitution says “the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being, without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.” Despite great progress over the past three quarters of a century, the goal of “health for all” remains elusive. Life expectancies in some countries in the Region are still a decade shorter than the regional average. And too many people still lack access to good-quality health services without financial burden. “We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable among us—leaving no one behind in the march towards better health and development.” Dr Jakab explains. “And we owe it to future generations whom the Organization will serve over the next 75 years to ensure they have equal opportunities for living long, healthy lives. “WHO – the only organization with this unique mandate, footprint and expertise – will continue to accelerate action to achieve health for all. It will take new ways of thinking and working, sustained funding and commitment from governments and a wide range of partners working alongside us to meet today’s health challenges and opportunities, and more in the future,” she adds. To protect all people in the Region from present and future threats and deliver on the promise of health for all, WHO and Member States are working together to build resilient health systems for universal health coverage, based upon a primary health-care approach.

In 2022 alone, WHO responded to 19 such threats in the Region, including mpox and human cases of avian flu. WHO is working with Member States to prepare for future pandemics, health emergencies and outbreaks, and to build resilient health systems that respond effectively to epidemics and prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections.

WHO is working with Member States to prepare for future pandemics, health emergencies and outbreaks, and to build resilient health systems that respond effectively to epidemics and prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections. Noncommunicable diseases and ageing Changing consumption patterns, lifestyles and rapid urbanization have led to an increase in NCDs such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. Almost nine out of 10 deaths in the Region today are due to NCDs. The Region also has one of the largest and fastest growing older populations in the world, increasing the demand for primary health care and long-term care. Recognizing that people’s health is largely determined by their social and physical environment, WHO is working across sectors to advocate for heathy societies, which help to reduce risk factors that lead to NCDs, improve mental health and reorient systems to support all people to live long, healthy and productive lives.

Climate change, the environment and health Climate change and environmental hazards such as air pollution, exposure to hazardous chemicals, and lack of water and sanitation pose serious threats to people’s health. At the same time, rising sea levels and extreme weather events associated with climate change can damage infrastructure and disrupt the delivery of health services, posing additional health and safety risks. WHO is supporting countries to monitor the health impacts of climate change and the environment—from warmer temperatures that increase vector-borne diseases to extreme weather that triggers more waterborne and foodborne diseases—and strengthen health sector resilience to withstand climate shocks.

Reaching the unreached In many countries, some groups—such as the poor, ethnic minorities or those in remote areas—still suffer from high rates of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis, and too many mothers and infants are still lost during pregnancy and birth. Vaccine coverage among some groups remains stubbornly low, leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases and needless death and disability. Health is still not for all, when the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups are left behind. WHO is working with Member States and partners in the Region to find new approaches, build on public health innovations to achieve equitable access to affordable, good-quality services, and deliver on the promise of universal health coverage—with strong primary health care and human resources at its base—for everyone, everywhere.

    "text": "Abuse of older people Key facts Around 1 in 6 people 60 years and older experienced some form of abuse in community settings during the past year. Rates of abuse of older people are high in institutions such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities, with 2 in 3 staff reporting that they have committed abuse in the past year. Rates of abuse of older people have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abuse of older people can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Abuse of older people is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations. The global population of people aged 60 years and older will more than double, from 900 million in 2015 to about 2 billion in 2050. Overview The abuse of older people, also known as elder abuse, is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect. Scope of the problem Abuse of older people is an important public health problem. A 2017 review of 52 studies in 28 countries from diverse regions estimated that over the past year 1 in 6 people (15.7%) aged 60 years and older were subjected to some form of abuse (1) . Although rigorous data are limited, the review provides prevalence estimates of the proportion of older people affected by different types of abuse (see Table 1). Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. However, a review of recent studies on abuse of older people in institutional settings (2) indicates that 64.2% of staff reported perpetrating some form of abuse in the past year.

A US study, for instance, suggests that rates in the community may have increased by as much as 84% (3) . Abuse of older people in community settings Abuse of older people in institutional settings Globally, the number of cases of elder abuse is projected to increase as many countries have rapidly ageing populations. Even if the proportion of victims of abuse of older people remains constant, the global number of victims will increase rapidly due to population ageing, growing to some 320 million victims by 2050, as the global population of people aged 60 years and more increases to 2 billion by 2050. Consequences Abuse of older people can have serious physical and mental health, financial, and social consequences, including, for instance, physical injuries, premature mortality, depression, cognitive decline, financial devastation and placement in nursing homes. For older people, the consequences of abuse can be especially serious and recovery may take longer (4) . Risk factors Individual level characteristics which increase the risk of becoming a victim of abuse include functional dependence/disability, poor physical health, cognitive impairment, poor mental health and low income. Individual level characteristics which increase the risk of becoming a perpetrator of abuse include mental illness, substance abuse and dependency – often financial – of the abuser on the victim. At the relationship level, the type of relationship (e.g., spouse/partner or child/parent) and marital status may be associated with an elevated risk of abuse, but these factors vary by country and region.

Community- and societal-level factors linked to elder abuse may include ageism against older people and certain cultural norms (e.g., normalization of violence). Social support and living alone reduce the likelihood of elder abuse (5) . Prevention Many strategies have been tried to prevent and respond to abuse of older people, but evidence for the effectiveness of most of these interventions is limited at present. Strategies considered most promising include caregiver interventions, which provide services to relieve the burden of caregiving; money management programmes for older adults vulnerable to financial exploitation; helplines and emergency shelters; and multi-disciplinary teams, as the responses required often cut across many systems, including criminal justice, health care, mental health care, adults protective services and long-term care ( 5 ). In some countries, the health sector has taken a leading role in raising public concern about abuse of older people, while in others the social welfare sector has taken the lead. Globally, too little is known about elder abuse and how to prevent it, particularly in developing countries. WHO response On 15 June 2022, World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, WHO and partners published “ Tackling abuse of older people: five priorities for the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) ”. These five priorities, arrived at through wide consultation, are: Combat ageism as it is a major reason why the abuse of older people receives so little attention. Generate more and better data to raise awareness of the problem. Develop and scale up cost–effective solutions to stop abuse of older people. Make an investment case focusing on how addressing the problem is money well spent. Raise funds as more resources are needed to tackle the problem.

Loneliness and social isolation are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life. One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers. Approximately 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder. Mental disorders among older adults account for 10.6% of the total years lived with disability for this age group. Overview The world’s population is ageing fast. In 2020, 1 billion people in the world were aged 60 years or over. That figure will rise to 1.4 billion by 2030, representing one in six people globally. By 2050, the number of people aged 60 years and over will have doubled to reach 2.1 billion. The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million (1) . Older adults contribute to society as family and community members, and many are volunteers and workers. While most have good health, many are at risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Many may also experience reduced mobility, chronic pain, frailty, dementia or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term care. As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time. Prevalence Around 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder (2) . According to the Global Health Estimates (GHE) 2019 , these conditions account for 10.6% of the total disability (in disability adjusted life years, DALYs) among older adults. The most common mental health conditions for older adults are depression and anxiety. GHE 2019 shows that globally, around a quarter of deaths from suicide (27.2%) are among people aged 60 or over. Mental health conditions among older people are often underrecognized and undertreated, and the stigma surrounding these conditions can make people reluctant to seek help. Risk factors At older ages, mental health is shaped not only by physical and social environments but also by the cumulative impacts of earlier life experiences and specific stressors related to ageing. Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress.

Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress. Older adults are more likely to experience adverse events such as bereavement, or a drop in income or reduced sense of purpose with retirement. Despite their many contributions to society, many older adults are subject to ageism , which can seriously affect people’s mental health. Social isolation and loneliness , which affect about a quarter of older people, are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life (3) . So too is abuse of older people , which includes any kind of physical, verbal, psychological, sexual or financial abuse, as well as neglect. One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers (4) . Abuse of older adults has serious consequences and can lead to depression and anxiety. Many older people are carers of spouses with chronic health conditions, such as dementia . The responsibilities of such care can be overwhelming and can affect the carer’s mental health. Some older adults are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, because of dire living conditions, poor physical health or lack of access to quality support and services. This includes older adults living in humanitarian settings and those living with chronic illnesses (such as heart disease, cancer or stroke), neurological conditions (such as dementia), or substance use problems. Promotion and prevention Mental health promotion and prevention strategies for older adults focus on supporting healthy ageing . That means creating physical and social environments that support well-being and enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. Key mental health promotion and prevention strategies for healthy ageing include: measures to reduce financial insecurity and income inequality; programmes to ensure safe and accessible housing, public buildings and transport; social support for older adults and their carers; support for healthy behaviours, especially to eat a balanced diet, be physically active, refrain from tobacco and reduce alcohol use; and health and social programmes targeted at vulnerable groups such as those who live alone or in remote areas and those living with a chronic health condition.

For older adults, social connection is particularly important to reduce risk factors such as social isolation and loneliness. At this stage of life, meaningful social activities can significantly improve positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life; they can also reduce depressive symptoms. Example interventions include befriending initiatives, community and support groups, social skills training, creative arts groups, leisure and education services and volunteering programmes. Protection from ageism and abuse is also critical. Key interventions include anti-discrimination policies and laws, educational interventions and intergenerational activities. A range of carer interventions – including respite care, advice, education, financial support and psychological interventions – can support carers to maintain a good and healthy caring relationship that avoids abuse of older people. Treatment and care Prompt recognition and treatment of mental health conditions (and associated neurological and substance use conditions) in older adults is essential. This should follow standards for integrated care for older people , which is community-based and focused on both the long-term care of older adults living with mental health conditions and declines in intrinsic capacity, as well as the education, training and support of carers. A mix of mental health interventions are usually recommended, alongside other supports to address the health, personal care and social needs of individuals. Dementia is often an important concern. It affects people’s mental health (for example, sparking symptoms of psychosis and depression), and requires access to quality mental health care. Responding to the abuse of older adults is also critical. Promising interventions include mandatory reporting of abuse, self-help groups, helplines and emergency shelters, psychological programmes for abusers, training of health care providers and other caregiver support interventions.

    "text": "Dementia Key facts In 2021, 57 million people had dementia worldwide, over 60% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases. Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies globally US$ 1.3 trillion, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day. Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly. Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also provide 70% of care hours for people living with dementia. Overview Dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. The illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age. Things that increase the risk of developing dementia include: age (more common in those 65 or older) high blood pressure (hypertension) high blood sugar (diabetes) being overweight or obese smoking drinking too much alcohol being physically inactive being socially isolated depression. Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care. Signs and symptoms Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities. Early signs and symptoms are: forgetting things or recent events losing or misplacing things getting lost",

Signs and symptoms Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities. Early signs and symptoms are: forgetting things or recent events losing or misplacing things getting lost when walking or driving being confused, even in familiar places losing track of time difficulties solving problems or making decisions problems following conversations or trouble finding words difficulties performing familiar tasks misjudging distances to objects visually. Common changes in mood and behaviour include: feeling anxious, sad, or angry about memory loss personality changes inappropriate behaviour withdrawal from work or social activities being less interested in other people’s emotions. Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the person’s cognitive functioning before becoming ill. Most symptoms become worse over time, while others might disappear or only occur in the later stages of dementia. As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowls, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them. Common forms of dementia Dementia is caused by many different diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly damage the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist.

Treatment and care There is no cure for dementia, but a lot can be done to support both people living with the illness and those who care for them. People with dementia can take steps to maintain their quality of life and promote their well-being by: being physically active taking part in activities and social interactions that stimulate the brain and maintain daily function. In addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms: Cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are used to treat Alzheimer disease. NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine are used for severe Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent additional damage to the brain due to vascular dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with severe symptoms of depression in people living with dementia if lifestyle and social changes don’t work, but these should not be the first option. If people living with dementia are at risk of hurting themselves or others, medicines like haloperidol and risperidone can help, but these should never be used as the first treatment Self-care For those diagnosed with dementia, there are things that can help manage symptoms: Stay physically active. Eat healthily. Stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Get regular check-ups with your doctor. Write down everyday tasks and appointments to help you remember important things. Keep up your hobbies and do things that you enjoy. Try new ways to keep your mind active. Spend time with friends and family and engage in community life. Plan ahead of time. Over time, it may be harder to make important decisions for yourself or your finances: Identify people you trust to support you in making decisions and help you communicate your choices. Create an advance plan to tell people what your choices and preferences are for care and support. Bring your ID with your address and emergency contacts when leaving the house. Reach out to family and friends for help. Talk to people you know about how they can help you. Join a local support group.

Risk factors and prevention Although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not an inevitable consequence of biological ageing. Further, dementia does not exclusively affect older people – young onset dementia (defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases. Studies show that people can reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia by being physically active , not smoking, avoiding harmful use of alcohol , controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Additional risk factors include depression, social isolation, low educational attainment, cognitive inactivity and air pollution . Human rights Unfortunately, people living with dementia are frequently denied the basic rights and freedoms available to others. In many countries, physical and chemical restraints are used extensively in care homes for older people and in acute-care settings, even when regulations are in place to uphold the rights of people to freedom and choice. An appropriate and supportive legislative environment based on internationally-accepted human rights standards is required to ensure the highest quality of care for people with dementia and their carers. WHO response WHO recognizes dementia as a public health priority. In May 2017, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017-2025 . The Plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for action – for policy-makers, international, regional and national partners, and WHO in the following areas: addressing dementia as a public health priority; increasing awareness of dementia and creating a dementia-inclusive society; reducing the risk of dementia; diagnosis, treatment and care; information systems for dementia; support for dementia carers; and, research and innovation To facilitate the monitoring of the global dementia action plan, WHO developed the Global Dementia Observatory (GDO), a data portal that collates country data on 35 key dementia",

    "text": "Assistive technology Key facts Assistive products can range from physical products such as wheelchairs, glasses, prosthetic limbs, white canes, and hearing aids to digital solutions such as speech recognition or time management software and captioning. Most people who use assistive technology use more than one product, making integrated services important. Globally, more than 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products. With an ageing global population and a rise in noncommunicable diseases, an estimated 3.5 billion people will need assistive technology by 2050. In many countries, most people who need assistive technology do not have access to it. Overview Assistive technology is an umbrella term for assistive products and their related systems and services. Assistive products help maintain or improve an individual’s functioning related to cognition, communication, hearing, mobility, self-care and vision, thus enabling their health, well-being, inclusion and participation. Improving access to assistive technology can contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and to ensuring that no one is left behind. This is through enabling the inclusion and participation of assistive technology users in their family, community and all areas of society, including the political, economic and social spheres. Who can benefit from assistive technology? Most people will need assistive technology at some point in their lives, especially as they age. While some may require assistive technology temporarily, such as after an accident or illness, others may require it for a longer period or throughout their lifespan. Assistive technology is most needed by: older people children and adults with disabilities people with long term health conditions such as diabetes, stroke and dementia. Benefits of assistive technology Assistive technology can help people in all aspects of their lives, including in education, employment, fitness, leisure and other everyday activities such as self-care, cooking and reading. Assistive technology can positively impact a person, their family and friends, and has broader socioeconomic benefits. For example: early provision of hearing aids for young children supports their development of language and communication skills, limiting negative impacts on their education, future employment and community participation; provision of appropriate wheelchairs facilitates mobility, improving individuals’ access to education and employment while reducing healthcare costs due to a reduction in secondary complications such as pressure sores and contractures; therapeutic footwear for diabetes reduces the incidence of foot ulcers, preventing amputations and the associated impact on individuals and burden on health-care systems; and timely provision",

Unmet global need The WHO and UNICEF Global report on assistive technology (2022) demonstrates considerable inequity in access to assistive technology. As few as 3% of people in some low-income countries were reported to have access to the assistive products they need, in comparison to 90% in some high-income countries. Examples of the unmet global need for specific assistive technology include: mobility: of the 80 million people who need a wheelchair, only 5­–35% have access to one , depending on the country in which they live; and hearing: globally, 1.5 billion people have hearing loss, yet hearing aid production currently meets less than 10% of the global demand. Unaddressed hearing loss across the globe leads to an annual cost of US$ 980 billion . Barriers impacting access to assistive technology include low awareness, high costs, limited physical access, inadequate product range, procurement challenges, workforce capacity gaps, inadequate policy, insufficient funding, assistive technology sector fragmentation and sociodemographic obstacles. Assistive technology within universal health coverage The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development places good health and well-being at the centre of a new development vision. It emphasizes universal health coverage (UHC) to ensure sustainable development for all so that everyone can access the health services needed without financial hardship. Addressing the unmet need for assistive products is crucial for achieving Sustainable Development Goals, providing UHC, and implementing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ‘Leaving no one behind’ means ensuring people with disabilities, the older population, those affected by chronic diseases and everyone who needs assistive technology are included in society and able to live healthy and dignified lives. What needs to be done? The WHO and UNICEF Global report on assistive technology (2022",

What needs to be done? The WHO and UNICEF Global report on assistive technology (2022) offers recommendations specifically intended to steer governments and other stakeholders towards achieving universal access to assistive technology. These 10 priority recommendations underline the ongoing efforts required to enhance access to assistive technology for all in need. Improve access to assistive technology within all development sectors. Ensure safe, effective and affordable assistive products. Enhance workforce capacity. Involve users and families in the entire assistive technology access pathway. Raise public awareness and combat stigma regarding assistive technology. Invest in data-driven policy. Foster research and innovation. Develop enabling environments that benefit everyone involved in assistive technology. Include assistive technology in humanitarian responses. Strengthen international cooperation on assistive technology. WHO response WHO is taking measures to address the global disparity in access to assistive technology, developing normative guidance and providing technical support to Member States to support them in implementing the 2018 World Health Assembly Resolution on Improving Access to Assistive Technology (WHA71.8). WHO uses the WHO-GATE 5P framework as a strategy for strengthening access to assistive technology in any context. This strategy places people at the centre and focuses equal attention on policy, products, provision and personnel as interconnected elements that must be aligned to ensure equitable access. WHO and UNICEF published the Global Report on Assistive Technology in 2022 , which provides the most comprehensive global evidence on assistive technology. WHO has developed a range of guidance, tools and resources in collaboration with other partners to support countries to strengthen their assistive technology provision systems. WHO is also the Secretariat for the Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology (GATE) Initiative , which brings together diverse stakeholders who share the vision of a world where assistive technology is universally accessible to everyone, everywhere.

In 2015, at the Sixty-sixth session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, Member States adopted a resolution on UHC and endorsed “Universal Health Coverage: Moving Towards Better Health” — an action framework that provides guidance for Member States to accelerate progress towards UHC and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The action framework recognizes that countries are on different pathways towards UHC and identifies five interrelated attributes of high-performing health systems: quality, efficiency, equity, accountability, sustainability, and resilience. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports the Member States to advance towards UHC by facilitating high-level multisectoral policy dialogues, providing strategic advice and technical assistance, strengthening country capacity, engaging with development partners to support national planning processes and ensure donor funding alignment with national health priorities, as well as providing a regional platform to review progress, identify priorities, and explore solutions to accelerate progress.

    "text": "The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and also includes the health system. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Social determinants of health are often responsible for health inequities – the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Beyond the immediate health outcomes, these health inequities have broader societal implications, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for educational and economic advancement. Addressing health inequities and their social determinants of health in the Western Pacific Region is not only a matter of public health but also a crucial step toward fostering a more just and inclusive society, with potential long-term benefits for both individuals, their families and society at large. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States in taking action on their social determinants of health by: Building capacity at national and local level to measure health inequities and their social determinants within and across countries and establishing regional and national monitoring systems. Designing and implementing strategies and programmes to address health inequities and their social determinants. Building investment cases for action on the social determinants of health. Calculating the economic footprint of the health system, including in deprived areas. Working to meaningful engage with diverse and representative communities and sectors for health. Fostering and facilitating knowledge exchange among Member States and relevant stakeholders on best practices for intersectoral action on how to identify and address health inequities.

Insightful discussions with the Penang State Health team The visit to Pusat Aktiviti Warga Emas (PAWE) Jelutong, a Senior Citizen Activity Centre, offered a powerful example of healthy ageing in action. Run in collaboration with the Penang Island City Council (MBPP), Rose Charities and the Penang Women’s Development Corporation, the centre supports older adults in staying active, connected and engaged. PAWE Jelutong exemplifies ageing in action—where older adults stay connected and engaged through care, purpose and community “This is our second home. We’re not just passing time—we’re learning, moving and making new friends,” shared a regular visitor at PAWE. Care for all stages of life At health facilities like the Jalan Perak Health Complex, Kepala Batas Hospital and the Sg Burung Community Clinic, the WHO team observed services supporting older adults through rehabilitation, chronic disease management and antenatal care. In Seberang Perai Utara, the team visited a Wellness Hub run by the Health Promotion Branch, offering preventive services like smoking cessation, nutrition counselling and creative arts therapy. One flagship programme—I-Fit-and-Eat-Right (IFitEr)—helps adults manage weight through structured behaviour change and lifestyle modification. Some 56.5% of adults in Penang are overweight or obese, this rate exceeds the already worrying national average, which makes such programmes important. Community members take part in structured lifestyle programmes at the Wellness Hub, supporting healthier living through fitness, nutrition and behavioural change Such initiatives not only prevent and delay decline in older age but promote autonomy and improve quality of life. The mission concluded with a meeting with the Penang Family Health Development Association a civil society partner delivering HIV and sexual and reproductive health services. Their inclusive approach—serving both citizens and non-citizens—highlights the importance of universal access across age, identity and background. Health check-ups that promote healthy ageing and community well-being As Malaysia’s population ages, Penang is demonstrating what it means to grow older with dignity, support and purpose in an inclusive environment. Through strong partnerships, innovative community programmes and a clear commitment to inclusion, the State is paving the way for more age-friendly health systems and environments.

The resolutions were adopted on the final day of the seventy-first session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, which was held virtually this week. Protecting all with immunization Delegates today endorsed the Regional Strategic Framework for Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization in the Western Pacific (2021–2030) . It calls on Member States to further strengthen and expand immunization systems and programmes along the life course, strategically manage health intelligence on vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, and ensure preparedness for and response to public health emergencies related to vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccines and immunization programmes. Countries and areas of the Region have achieved many successes in eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases, such as maintaining polio-free status over the Region since 2000, eliminating measles in nine countries and rubella in five countries in 2019, and reducing chronic hepatitis B infection among children. However, many people are still being missed by immunization efforts, leading to the emergence, resurgence and large-scale outbreaks over the past two years of vaccine-preventable diseases such as vaccine-derived poliovirus, measles and diphtheria in high-risk communities within the Region. While more vaccines are now available for various age groups such as adolescents, adults and older people and against various diseases such as cervical cancer, pneumococcal disease and seasonal flu, the expansion of immunization service delivery throughout the life course has not yet occurred in many countries. Moreover, immunization systems and programmes are still not resilient enough to withstand major public health emergencies. The Framework adopted today sets out 18 strategies to expand the scope of immunization, maximize the benefits of vaccines and immunization programmes in the Region, and achieve and sustain elimination of additional vaccine-preventable diseases beyond those traditionally targeted, aiming to make the Region free from vaccine-preventable morbidity, mortality and disability towards 2030. Safe and affordable surgery Delegates endorsed the Action Framework for Safe and Affordable Surgery in the Western Pacific Region (2021–2030) .

It calls for the development of well-functioning “surgical ecosystems” to solve service delivery problems and achieve universal access to safe and affordable surgery. Surgical care saves lives and improves the quality of life of millions of people every year. Most people will require surgical care at some point in their lives, for a disease or condition such as complications of obstructed labour, a birth defect, cataracts, cancer, heart disease, stroke, complications of diabetes, and burns or injuries from domestic, industrial or road accidents. But access to safe and affordable surgery remains limited in the Region. Geographical challenges can make it hard for people on far-flung islands and other remote areas to access advanced care. It remains unaffordable for many in places where patients need to pay out of pocket. There are challenges for patient safety due to the complexity of care and the risk of infection. Historically, it has been less prominent in the long-term health plans of countries and opportunities have been missed to build up surgical ecosystems – networks of skilled health workers, processes, equipment and other material necessary for delivering quality surgical care. The Framework adopted today guides countries through a process of bringing together stakeholders to generate a shared vision, collaborate on evidence-based action, redesign existing systems, and strengthen information to measure progress and inform further action. Healthy ageing Delegates endorsed the Regional Actional Plan on Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific. It calls for the transformation of societies and health systems to promote healthy ageing. More than 240 million people aged 65 years and over live in the Western Pacific Region, and this number is expected to double by 2050. Changing population demographics have significant health, social and economic implications such as a shift in disease burden towards noncommunicable diseases and a growing population with more diverse health and social needs. But challenges can turn into opportunities when societies become more age-friendly. People who live longer and healthier can engage in activities over their whole lifetime. A growing older population that is better educated and healthier can contribute more, through doing paid and unpaid work, consuming and investing, passing down knowledge and traditions, and acting as caregivers for young family members.

    "text": "Samoa: promoting COVID-19 prevention among vulnerable populations At the time of writing, Samoa is free of COVID-19. Preventative and precautionary measures were implemented early and continue. WHO has played a strong role in keeping COVID-19 at bay in Samoa by supporting a mass media campaign, training clinical teams on prevention, screening, testing as well as carrying out isolation, case management and intensifying mental health services. WHO's COVID-19 support to Samoa also includes an initiative with the Samoa Red Cross Society (SRCS) and the Adventists Disaster Relief Agency (ADRA) to intensify public education on COVID-19. It builds on the early COVID-19 sensitization sessions held for approximately 200 village chiefs, mayors, religious leaders and women's community group representatives from the four inhabited Samoan Islands Upolu, Savai'i, Manono and Apolima. As part of the initiative, WHO collaborated with the Ministry of Health and the SRCS to develop a COVID-19 training toolkit to deliver standardized information sessions on COVID-19. The toolkit includes a component on home-based care. In July, WHO joined the SRCS in Manono and Apolima, two of Samoa's smaller islands, where more assessments were conducted and hygiene kit care packages and water were distributed to vulnerable families. The unavailability of clean water for hand-washing, cooking and general hygiene is a barrier to preventing and managing COVID-19 infection. This and other barriers are the backbone of WHO's collaboration with SRCS and ADRA to better understand families' vulnerability to COVID-19 and to provide them with the hygiene supplies. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

    "text": "Protecting older people against COVID-19 The WHO Western Pacific Region is home to more than a third of the world’s older people. For many of these 240 million people aged over 65 years, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thrown up new challenges. COVID-19 affects older adults disproportionately, especially those living in long-term care facilities, with a significant impact on mortality and morbidity. To ensure their health and well-being during the pandemic, WHO has recently published a range of guidance documents and tools for long-term care facilities, older people and communities. It is complemented by an online course to improve infection prevention and control in long-term care facilities. Preventing and controlling infection in residential facilities Older people living in long-term care facilities are in frequent contact with caregivers and other staff working in the facility. Residents may also receive visits from family members and friends, increasing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Indeed, outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported at long-term care facilities in countries of the Western Pacific Region. To address these challenges, WHO has published guidance on preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 in such facilities and at home. A communication toolkit and a preparedness checklist have also been published to support education and training of staff and to ensure that facilities are prepared for possible outbreaks of COVID-19. “The toolkit has advice for facility managers, staff, residents and family members,” explains Hiromasa Okayasu, WHO Coordinator for Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific Region. “The measures described are simple and easy to put into place and will make a significant difference in protecting residents against COVID-19.” WHO also offers a free, online course for long-term care facility staff in the context of COVID-19 . Its four modules address different aspects of infection prevention and control. Participants learn to describe infection prevention and control principles and practices relevant to long-term care facilities for patient and staff safety, apply the COVID-19 long-term care facility preparedness checklist to their place of work, identify practices to safely manage long-term care facility residents, and understand how to support themselves and each other as staff of long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staying well at home Older people living at home are also facing new difficulties during this pandemic. Physical distancing and lockdown measures mean that many older people are not able to carry out their regular activities. Gunhee Lee, a 75-year-old woman from the Republic of Korea is finding this change difficult. “Before the COVID-19 outbreak, I was very active,” she says. She participated in hobby groups, volunteered to help ill neighbours and sold home-made traditional food and drinks at a local café. But the pandemic has put a stop to her activities. “I try to stay at home; we need to follow the physical distancing measures strictly,” she explains. To help older people stay well at home, WHO has published a self-care guide . Designed for older people and their caregivers, it focuses on what can be done at home to improve health and well-being, such as personal health checks, physical activity and eating well. Community-based integrated care Staying connected to others is another key part of maintaining health and well-being. However, with many welfare centres and other social services disrupted during this time, social isolation of older people is a growing concern. Older people with difficulty using digital technology could experience a disconnect from their community. A recent WHO guidance provides advice on how to help older people stay connected as we adapt to the “new normal”. For Gunhee Lee, for example, receiving regular phone calls from her local welfare centre has made a huge difference. “I’m always so happy to hear their voices,” she says. “They also send text messages to inform us of the district’s contact tracing and updates on new cases.” Using community-based resources, such as welfare centres, is the key to promoting the health of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future. With health, long-term care and social sectors working together, older people can access person-centred, integrated care in the community so they can “age in place”. A new future COVID-19 has resulted in many challenges for older people, but it also presents new opportunities. The new WHO guidance and tools can help long-term care facilities, communities and countries become safer and create a “new future” in which older people can safely thrive.

More than 99% of the population live in areas where the air pollution is above WHO air quality guidelines and 4.2 million deaths are attributed to ambient air pollution each year. Ambient and household air pollution can come from similar processes such as incomplete combustion of fuels or chemical reactions between gases. However, the specific source of the combustion process can vary. For example, household activities such as cooking and heating with dirty technologies, and lighting with kerosene, emits a range of health harmful pollutants indoors, while activities such as high temperature combustion in vehicles, industries and power generating facilities contribute to ambient air pollution. Activities such as boiling water for bathing or cooking animal fodder can also add to household air pollution exposures. Pollutants with the strongest evidence for public health concern include particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). Health problems can occur as a result of both short- and long-term exposure to these various pollutants. For some pollutants, there are no thresholds below which adverse effects do not occur. Pollutants which are included in the WHO global air quality guidelines are presented firstly followed by pollutants for which there are good practice statements but no quantitative values. Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM) refers to inhalable particles, composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust or water. PM can be of different size and is generally defined by their aerodynamic diameter, with PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 the most common in the regulatory framework and relevant for health. Sources of the largest particles called coarse particles (particles with diameter between 2.5 µm and 10 µm) will mainly consist of pollen, sea spray and wind-blown dust from erosion, agricultural spaces, roadways and mining operations. The finer particles (i.e., PM 2.5 ) can be derived from primary sources (e.g., combustion of fuels in power generation facilities, industries or vehicles) and secondary sources (e",

The finer particles (i.e., PM 2.5 ) can be derived from primary sources (e.g., combustion of fuels in power generation facilities, industries or vehicles) and secondary sources (e.g., chemical reactions between gases). The greatest source of particulate matter around the home is generally the combustion of polluting fuels in open hearths or poorly vented, inefficient stoves or space heaters. In addition to household activities like cooking, space heating, and lighting, other activities can be important sources of particulate matter pollution in the home environment, such as preparing animal fodder, heating water for bathing and brewing beverages. In outdoor environments, the main sources are location-specific and can be made up of different different origins but typically include traffic and transportation, industrial activities, power plants, construction sites, waste burning, fires or fields. The health risks associated with particulate matter of less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) are especially well documented. PM is capable of penetrating deep into the lung and enter the bloodstream causing cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease), cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts. Both long-term and short-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure has been further linked to adverse perinatal outcomes and lung cancer. In 2013, it was classified as a cause of lung cancer by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It is also the most widely used indicator for assessing the health effects of exposure to air pollution. Read more about particulate matter in the Air Quality Guidelines . Nitrogen Dioxide Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a reddish-brown gas that is soluble in water, and a strong oxidant. Ambient sources of NO 2 results from high temperature combustion of fuels in processes such as those used for heating, transportation, industry and power generation.

Exposure to nitrogen dioxide can irritate airways and aggravate respiratory diseases. NO 2 is an important ozone precursor, a pollutant closely linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions. Read more about nitrogen dioxide here and here . Ozone Ground-level ozone (O 3 ) is a major component of smog. It is formed from photochemical reactions with pollutants such volatile organic compounds , carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from vehicles, and industry. Due to the photochemical nature, the highest levels of ozone are seen during periods of sunny weather. It is worth mentioning that ozone can also be generated by household equipment, such as portable air cleaners. Exposure to excessive ozone can cause problems breathing, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and lead to lung disease. Read more about ozone here and here . Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, coal, natural gas and kerosene in simple stoves, open fires, wick lamps, furnaces, fireplaces. The predominant source of carbon monoxide (CO) in ambient air is from motor vehicles. Carbon monoxide diffuses across the lung tissues and into the bloodstream, making it difficult for the body’s cells to bind to oxygen. This lack of oxygen damages tissues and cells. Exposure to carbon monoxide can cause difficulties breathing, exhaustion, dizziness, and other flu-like symptoms. Exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be deadly. Read more about carbon monoxide here and here . Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) is a colourless gas that is readily soluble in water. It is predominantly derived from the combustion of fossil fuels for domestic heating, industries and power generation.

It is predominantly derived from the combustion of fossil fuels for domestic heating, industries and power generation. Exposure to SO 2 is associated with asthma hospital admissions and emergency room visits. Read more about sulfur dioxide here and here . Lead Lead (Pb) and lead particulate compounds can be found in the home in contaminated dust from products such as paints, ceramics, pipes and plumbing materials, solders, gasoline, batteries, ammunition, and cosmetics. Lead can also be found in ambient air from vehicle exhaust of fuel with lead. Lead poses health risks of particular concern for children and pregnant women. The health impacts for children exposed to lead include behaviour and learning problems, lower IQ and hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing problems, and anemia. In rare cases, ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma and even death. For pregnant women, health risks include reduced growth of the fetus and premature birth. Adults exposed to lead also have a higher risk of cardiovascular effects increased blood pressure, the incidence of hypertension, decreased kidney function and risk of reproductive problems in both men and women. Read more about lead poisoning here and here . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are present in the atmosphere in particulate form. They are a group of chemicals formed primarily from incomplete combustion of organic matter (e.g. cooking of meat) as well as fossil fuels in coke ovens, diesel engines and wood-burning stoves. They are also emitted from tobacco smoke. Short-term exposure can irritate eyes and breathing passages. Long-term exposure to PAH has been linked to lung cancer. Read more about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons here . Formaldehyde Formaldehyde is a colourless gas with a pungent smell. It is one of the most common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found indoors. Formaldehyde is emitted from building materials (e.g. particleboard, plywood, glue, paints) as well as household and personal care products (e.g. drapes, carpets, cleaning products, hair sprays). Additional indoor sources may be combustion processes such as smoking, heating, cooking, or candle or incense burning. Short-term exposure to formaldehyde can lead to eye, nose and throat irritation as well as increased allergic sensitization. However, long-term exposure to formaldehyde",

Black carbon Black carbon is a major component of PM 2.5 and it is sometimes referred to as soot and its main sources are from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass. It can be emitted both from anthropogenic (e.g. diesel vehicles, biomass cookstoves) and natural (e.g. wildfires) sources. It is also a potent warming agent in the atmosphere and contributes to regional environmental disruption and accelerates glacier melting.

The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in some regions. Overview Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2019; this mortality is due to exposure to fine particulate matter, which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. WHO estimates that in 2019, some 68% of outdoor air pollution related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 14% were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14% were due to acute lower respiratory infections, and 4% of deaths were due to lung cancers. People living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 89% (of the 4.2 million premature deaths) occurring in these areas. The greatest burden is found in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death. Policies reducing air pollution Addressing air pollution, which is the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases , is key to protecting public health. Most sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and this demands concerted action by local, national and regional level policy-makers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning and agriculture. There are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution: for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as",

There are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution: for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas); for energy: ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating and lighting; for transport: shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content; for urban planning: improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more green and compact, and thus energy efficient; for power generation: increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation); for municipal and agricultural waste management: strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing, as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste – where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical; and for health-care activities: putting health services on a low-carbon development path can support more resilient and cost-efficient service delivery, along with reduced environmental health risks for patients, health workers and the community. In supporting climate friendly policies, the health sector can display public leadership while also improving health service delivery.

Carbon monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, charcoal, natural gas and kerosene. Ozone (O 3 ) Ozone at ground level – not to be confused with the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere – is one of the major constituents of photochemical smog and it is formed through the reaction with gases in the presence of sunlight. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) NO 2 is a gas that is commonly released from the combustion of fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors. Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) SO 2 is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. To read more details about these pollutants and other types, please visit this page . Air quality guidelines The WHO Global air quality guidelines (AQG) offer global guidance on thresholds and limits for key air pollutants that pose health risks. These guidelines are of a high methodological quality and are developed through a transparent, evidence-based decision-making process. In addition to the guideline values, the WHO Global air quality guidelines provide interim targets to promote a gradual shift from high to lower concentrations and their associated health benefits. For example, through the achievement of interim target one (35 µg/m 3 ), around 300 000 deaths would be saved worldwide annually. The guidelines also offer qualitative statements on good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (PM), for example black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms, for which there is insufficient quantitative evidence to derive AQG levels. WHO response Recognizing the gravity and urgency of the problem, all WHO Member States approved resolution A68.8, “Health and the Environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution,” at the World Health Assembly in 2015, complemented by a road map for action the following year.

WHO response Recognizing the gravity and urgency of the problem, all WHO Member States approved resolution A68.8, “Health and the Environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution,” at the World Health Assembly in 2015, complemented by a road map for action the following year. WHO, as the coordinating authority on international health, supports countries in protecting public health through evidence-based policies and actions. Considering the significant health burden and the multiple potential benefits of interventions, WHO supports countries by providing evidence, building institutional capacity and leveraging the health argument to convene sectors to tackle air pollution. To support reducing air pollution levels and to protect populations from health risks, WHO’s Air Quality and Health Unit works in three cross-cutting areas: 1. knowledge, evidence and measuring progress 2. institutional capacity building and technical support 3. leadership and coordination. Member States and sub-national entities are typically responsible for the implementation and monitoring of policies to promote air quality for health. Successful policies and solid governance depend on coordinated action between a variety of stakeholders and sec- tors. Cooperation with other UN agencies and non-state actors is essential and is integrated into WHO’s work to ensure synergies and maximize impact on the ground.

    "text": "Household air pollution Key facts Around 2.1 billion people worldwide (around a third of the global population) cook using open fires or inefficient stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal, which generates harmful household air pollution. Household air pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year in 2020, including over 237 000 deaths of children under the age of 5. The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. Household air pollution exposure leads to noncommunicable diseases including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Women and children, typically responsible for household chores such as cooking collecting firewood, bear the greatest health burden from the use of polluting fuels and technologies in homes. It is essential to expand use of clean fuels and technologies to reduce household air pollution and protect health. These include solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Overview Worldwide, around 2.1 billion people still cook using solid fuels (such as wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and dung) and kerosene in open fires and inefficient stoves (1) . Most of these people are poor and live in low- and middle-income countries. There is a large discrepancy in access to cleaner cooking alternatives between urban and rural areas: in 2021, only 14% of people in urban areas relied on polluting fuels and technologies, compared with 49% of the global rural population. Household air pollution is generated by the use of inefficient and polluting fuels and technologies in and around the home that contains a range of health-damaging pollutants, including small particles that penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. In poorly ventilated dwellings, indoor smoke can have levels of fine particles 100 times higher than acceptable. Exposure is particularly high among women and children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. Reliance on polluting fuels and technologies also require significant time for cooking on an inefficient device, and gathering and preparing fuel.

Exposure is particularly high among women and children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. Reliance on polluting fuels and technologies also require significant time for cooking on an inefficient device, and gathering and preparing fuel. Guidance In light of the widespread use of polluting fuels and stoves for cooking, WHO issued a set of normative guidance, the Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion , which offer practical evidence-based guidance on what fuels and technologies used in the home can be considered clean, including recommendations discouraging use of kerosene and recommending against use of unprocessed coal; specifying the performance of fuels and technologies (in the form of emission rate targets) needed to protect health; and emphasizing the importance of addressing all household energy uses, particularly cooking, space heating and lighting to ensure benefits for health and the environment. WHO defines fuels and technologies that are clean for health at the point of use as solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Without strong policy action, 1.8 billion people are estimated to still lack access to clean fuels and technologies in 2030 (1) . There is a particularly critical need for action in sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth has outpaced access to clean cooking, and 923 million people lacked access in 2022. Strategies to increase the adoption of clean household energy include policies that provide financial support to purchase cleaner technologies and fuels, improved ventilation or housing design, and communication campaigns to encourage clean energy use. Impacts on health Each year, 3.2 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributable to the household air pollution caused by the incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking (see household air pollution data for details). Particulate matter and other pollutants in household air pollution inflame the airways and lungs, impair immune response and reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Among these 3.2 million deaths from household air pollution exposure: 32% are from ischaemic heart disease : 12% of all deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for over a million premature deaths annually, can be attributed to exposure to household air pollution; 23% are from stroke : approximately 12% of",

Household air pollution is a risk for acute lower respiratory infections in adults and contributes to 22% of all adult deaths due to pneumonia; 19% are from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): 23% of all deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults in low- and middle-income countries are due to exposure to household air pollution; and 6% are from lung cancer : approximately 11% of lung cancer deaths in adults are attributable to exposure to carcinogens from household air pollution caused by using kerosene or solid fuels like wood, charcoal or coal for household energy needs. Household air pollution accounted for the loss of an estimated 86 million healthy life years in 2019, with the largest burden falling on women living in low- and middle-income countries. Almost half of all deaths due to lower respiratory infection among children under 5 years of age are caused by inhaling particulate matter (soot) from household air pollution. There is also evidence of links between household air pollution and low birth weight, tuberculosis, cataract, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers.

Women and children disproportionately bear the greatest health burden from polluting fuels and technologies in homes as they typically labour over household chores such as cooking and collecting firewood and spend more time exposed to harmful smoke from polluting stoves and fuels. Gathering fuel increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and consumes considerable time for women and children – limiting education and other productive activities. In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence while gathering fuel. Many of the fuels and technologies used by households for cooking, heating and lighting present safety risks. The ingestion of kerosene by accident is the leading cause of childhood poisonings, and a large fraction of the severe burns and injuries occurring in low- and middle-income countries are linked to household energy use for cooking, heating and lighting (2) . The lack of access to electricity for over 750 million (1) people forces households to rely on polluting devices and fuels, such as kerosene lamps for lighting, thus making them exposed to very high levels of fine particulate matter. The time spent using and preparing fuel for inefficient, polluting devices constrains other opportunities for health and development, like studying, leisure time, or productive activities. Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Household air pollution is also a major contributor to ambient (outdoor) air pollution . WHO response WHO provides technical support and capacity building to countries and regions to evaluate and scale-up health-promoting household fuels and technologies. To address household air pollution and its negative impact on health, WHO: develops guidelines for indoor air quality and household fuel combustion , to provide health-based recommendations on the types of fuels and technologies that protect health, and effective strategies for the dissemination and adoption of cleaner household fuels and technologies; builds capacity at the country and regional level through direct consultations and workshops on household energy and health; maintains the global household energy database to monitor progress in the transition to cleaner fuels and stove combinations in households, reporting as the custodian agency for reporting on SDG indicator 7.1.2 , the proportion of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies .

Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. In order to present air quality data that represent human exposure, we used mainly urban measurements, comprising urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas or rural areas and industrial areas close to urban settlements. The database is updated regularly every 2-3 years since 2011. The data compiled in this database is used as input to derive the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 11.6.2, Air quality in cities, for which WHO is custodial agency. The primary sources of data were official countries reports sent to WHO upon request, official national and subnational reports, national and subnational websites that contain measurements of PM 10 , PM 2.5 or NO 2 . The Sixth version of the database (V6.1) was released in January 2024 and currently hosts data from 7 182 human settlements in more than 120 member states. Limitations Data from different countries are of limited comparability because of: The coverage is not comprehensive and only captures a small fraction of cities in some countries Omission of data which are known to exist, but which could not yet be accessed due to language issues or limited accessibility The measure is localized (city average are an average of ground measurement stations) Large heterogeneity of measurement methods and techniques Different temporal coverage of certain measurements included: if only part of the year was covered, the measurement may significantly deviate from the annual mean due to seasonal variability Possible inclusion of data which were not eligible for this database due to insufficient information to assess compliance Heterogeneous quality of measurements What it can do: ✅️ serve as input data in models to estimates air pollution exposure with topographic, population and satellite data together with chemicals transport models among other. ✅️ contribute to advocate for better monitoring of air quality everywhere ✅️ acknowledge growing effort of the number of monitoring stations",

What it cannot do: ❌️ draw direct comparison between countries ❌️ rank the most polluted cities Ideally, the monitoring data used to calculate the average annual PM and NO 2 concentrations should be collected throughout the year, for several years, to reduce bias owing to seasonal fluctuations or to a non-representative year. Care should be taken that the monitors used are not unduly influenced by a single source of pollution (i.e. a power plant, factory or highway); rather, the monitors should reflect exposures over a wide area. Although it is likely that PM and NO 2 data will be available only for larger cities, residents of agglomerations of less than 100 000 inhabitants and of rural areas are also exposed to PM and NO 2 from local industrial activity, transportation, biomass fuels, open burning and regional haze.

Likely impacts in many countries include those associated with extreme weather events and natural disasters, lack of sufficient quantities and quality of fresh water, impacts of compromised food security, and increased incidence of communicable diseases including vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, tick-borne diseases and plague are particularly susceptible for a number of reasons: the geographical distribution and behaviour of vectors and their hosts are intimately associated with environmental determinants, and transmission dynamics tend to favour warmer, wetter environments. Human responses to climate change, such as increased urbanization following farming failures and storage of water for household use, may also place populations at risk of vector borne diseases. Member States in Western Pacific Region have endorsed resolutions and developed national adaptation programmes of action and other climate change vulnerability analyses and plans to address and respond to climate change and health threats. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office works closely with Member states to build capacity at country and regional levels to minimize the consequences of vector-borne diseases for populations in areas that are prone to climate change.

Populations around the world struggle with food and water security, face the threat of outbreak of waterborne and vectorborne diseases, and experience increased pressure on scarce resources triggering climate-related migration and conflicts. Nowhere can these threats lead to more serious consequences than in the Pacific Island countries and areas. The combination of extreme exposure to climate-related disasters, such as cyclones, floods, and droughts, and the long-term rise in sea level coupled with geographically dispersed populations in remote small islands with fragile health systems, means climate change is an existential threat to Pacific islanders. WHO has been working with the vulnerable countries in the past decade to develop national climate change and health action plans based on the vulnerability and capacity assessments. With WHO support, the least developed countries (LDCs) in the Pacific and the Mekong areas are starting large-scale multi-year projects to build climate-resilient health systems. In addition, Pacific Island countries are working together to implement the Pacific Action Plan on Climate Change and Health in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Initiative.

Analysing the latest data on the environment-disease nexus and the devastating impact of environmental hazards and risks on global health, backed up by expert opinion, this report covers more than 100 diseases and injuries. The updated analysis for the year 2016 (results can be downloaded below under “Updated 2016 data tables”) shows that 24% of global deaths (and 28% of deaths among children under five) are due to modifiable environmental factors. Sixty-eight percent of these attributable deaths and 51% of attributable DALYs could be estimated with evidence-based comparative risk assessment methods, the assessments of other environmental exposures were completed through additional epidemiological estimates and expert opinion. Ischaemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and unintentional injuries head the list. People in low- and middle income countries bear the greatest disease burden. These assessments should add impetus to coordinating global efforts to promote healthy environments – often through well-established, cost-effective interventions. This analysis will inform those who want to better understand the transformational spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by Heads of State in September 2015. The results of the analysis underscore the pressing importance of stronger intersectoral action to create healthier environments that will contribute to sustainably improving the lives of millions around the world.

A new coalition of Asia-Pacific countries, backed by WHO, plans to change that Over 20 WHO Western Pacific Member States gather in Singapore to address healthcare sector’s role in contributing to, and tackling, the climate crisis Singapore, 18 September 2025 – Globally, 5% of total climate emissions come from the healthcare sector, contributing to the ever-mounting global threat of climate change. To address this specific challenge, the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office and the Centre for Sustainable Medicine at the National University of Singapore convened representatives from more than 20 Asia-Pacific countries* to chart a roadmap to transform the region’s healthcare systems to adapt to the changing climate, lower their carbon emissions, and become more environmentally sustainable. The Inaugural Western Pacific Action Forum on Climate-Resilient and Sustainable Health Systems spotlighted the urgent need to invest in climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems – a win-win strategy that helps protect lives, strengthens national preparedness against multiple hazards, and reduces costs through sustainable and efficient measures. Climate-resilient health systems reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events, natural hazards, disease outbreaks and compound crises. Most health system carbon emissions stem from supply chain activities. Measuring baseline emissions can generate efficiency and savings that may be reinvested to protect health. Integrated approaches not only improve health outcomes but also support national climate and development goals. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, through its Asia-Pacific Centre for Environment and Health, is working with Member States to strengthen and expand the global Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH). Malaysia recently became the eleventh country in the Region to join ATACH, swiftly followed by the Cook Islands as the twelfth, reinforcing regional momentum. Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, opened the Forum with a strong call to action, stating, “The climate crisis is projected to cause an additional 250 000 deaths every year between 2030 and 2050. Investing in climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems is therefore one of the smartest, and possibly one of the least complex, choices we can make. It saves lives today while preparing our communities, and the health systems that safeguard them, for the future.” Mr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information, and Ministry of National Development, Singapore, reaffirmed his country’s",

Investing in climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems is therefore one of the smartest, and possibly one of the least complex, choices we can make. It saves lives today while preparing our communities, and the health systems that safeguard them, for the future.” Mr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information, and Ministry of National Development, Singapore, reaffirmed his country’s commitment to climate action in the health sector. “Singapore is taking steps to lower our healthcare sector emissions … The actions we take will not only safeguard the health of our people but also strengthen the resilience and sustainability of our healthcare system in the face of mounting climate change challenges. By working closely together, we can transform the way healthcare is delivered, creating a healthier future for both people and planet.” Stressing the importance of collaboration across sectors, Dr Susan Mercado, Director for Programme Management, WHO Western Pacific, emphasized, “The Forum provided us with an opportunity for countries to share experiences and learn from one another. Almost 99% of the world’s population breathes air with pollution levels exceeding WHO air quality limits, reminding us that no country is immune. Regional collaboration, recognizing that all countries are ultimately connected, is key to accelerating climate and health action.” The Forum aimed to foster policy and budgetary commitments to embed climate resilience and low-carbon strategies into national health system planning and implementation. Over two days in Singapore, participants engaged in technical sessions, policy dialogue and knowledge exchange designed to inspire solutions, strengthen partnerships and accelerate implementation. Professor Nick Watts, the Director of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine at the National University of Singapore, spoke about the broader vision, stressing, “This is not only about protecting people’s health but also about contributing to climate and development goals, especially with the finish line of the Sustainable Development Goals barely five years away. A healthier, more resilient future is still possible if we act together.” *Countries participating in the Forum are (in alphabetical order): Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Mongolia, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Viet Nam.

SAFER was developed to deliver health and development gains in order to meet global, regional and country health and development goals and targets and to reduce human suffering and pain caused by the harmful use of alcohol. The objective of the initiative is to provide support for Member States in reducing the harmful use of alcohol by strengthening the ongoing implementation of the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, the Global alcohol action plan and other WHO and United Nations instruments – including WHO’s Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs2 and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target 3.5 (i.e. Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol). There is a substantial knowledge available about the magnitude of alcohol related harm and effective interventions to reduce this harm. Key decisions have been made in WHO and in UN to give alcohol a high priority globally and to implement effective solutions; it is time to deliver. Thus SAFER will be focusing on the most cost-effective priority interventions (“best buys”) using a set of WHO tools and resources to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm: S trengthen restrictions on alcohol availability A dvance and enforce drink driving countermeasures F acilitate access to screening, brief interventions, and treatment E nforce bans or comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising, sponsorship, and promotion R aise prices on alcohol through excise taxes and pricing policies SAFER consists of three components working together to support delivery of the WHO “best buys” and the WHO global alcohol strategy: 1. A WHO-led package of technical guidance on effective policy and program interventions. 2. A WHO/UN-led operational programme focusing on country action. 3. A multi-stakeholder communications and advocacy campaign The implementation of the five SAFER interventional will be led by the relevant Member States and the Global SAFER initiative will be coordinated and managed by WHO Headquarters and its regional and country offices in collaboration with UNDP and the United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs and with strong involvement from participating Member States and civil society organizations.",

The adopted resolution and endorsed strategy gives guidance to both Member States and to the WHO Secretariat on ways to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The vision behind the global strategy is improved health and social outcomes for individuals, families and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The global strategy aims to give guidance for action at all levels; to set priority areas for global action; and to recommend a portfolio of policy options and measures that could be considered for implementation and adjusted as appropriate at the national level, taking into account national circumstances, such as religious and cultural contexts, national public health priorities, as well as resources, capacities and capabilities.

    "text": "Alcohol Key facts Alcohol or alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, a psychoactive and toxic substance that can cause dependence. Worldwide, around 2.6 million deaths were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019. Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300 000 deaths from communicable diseases. The alcohol-attributable mortality was heaviest among men, accounting for 2 million deaths compared to 600 000 deaths among women, in 2019. An estimated 400 million people, or 7% of the world’s population aged 15 years and older, lived with alcohol use disorders. Of this, 209 million people (3.7% of the adult world population) lived with alcohol dependence. Alcohol consumption, even at low levels can bring health risks, but most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption. Effective alcohol control interventions exist and should be utilized more, at the same time it is important for people to know risks associated with alcohol consumption and take individual actions to protect from its harmful effects. Overview Alcohol and alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which is a psychoactive and toxic substance with dependence-producing properties. Alcohol has been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated with significant health risks and harms. Worldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women. The highest levels of alcohol-related deaths per 100 000 persons are observed in the WHO European and African Regions with 52.9 deaths and 52.2 deaths per 100 000 people, respectively. People of younger age (20–39 years) are disproportionately affected by alcohol consumption with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths occurring within this age group in 2019. The data on global alcohol consumption in 2019 shows that an estimated 400 million people aged 15 years and older live with alcohol use disorders, and an estimated 209 million live with alcohol dependence. There has been some progress; from 2010 to 2019, the number of alcohol-attributable deaths per 100 000 people decreased by 20.2% globally. There has been a steady increase in the number of countries developing national alcohol policies. Almost all countries implement alcohol excise taxes.

There has been a steady increase in the number of countries developing national alcohol policies. Almost all countries implement alcohol excise taxes. However, countries report continued interference from the alcohol industry in policy development. Based on 2019 data, about 54% out of 145 reporting countries had national guidelines/standards for specialized treatment services for alcohol use disorders, but only 46% of countries had legal regulations to protect the confidentiality of people in treatment. Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in all countries where such data are available. Health risks of alcohol use Alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development, occurrence and outcomes. Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders. An estimated 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019. Alcohol is an established carcinogen and alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, head and neck, oesophageal and colorectal cancers. In 2019, 4.4% of cancers diagnosed globally and 401 000 cancer deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption also causes significant harm to others, not just to the person consuming alcohol. A significant part of alcohol-attributable disease burden arises from injuries such as road traffic accidents. In 2019, of a total of 298 000 deaths from alcohol-related road crashes, 156 000 deaths were caused by someone else’s drinking. Other injuries, intentional or unintention",

Other injuries, intentional or unintentional, include falls, drowning, burns, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and suicide. A causal relationship has been established between alcohol use and the incidence or outcomes of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of having a child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the most severe form of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with developmental disabilities and birth defects. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can also increase the risk of pre-term birth complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery. Younger people are disproportionately negatively affected by alcohol consumption, with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths in 2019 occurring among people aged between 20 and 39 years. In the long term, harmful and hazardous levels of alcohol consumption can lead to social problems including family problems, issues at work, financial problems, and unemployment. Factors affecting alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm There is no form of alcohol consumption that is risk-free. Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risks and can cause harm. The level of risk depends on several factors, including the amount consumed, frequency of drinking, the health status of the individual, age, sex, and other personal characteristics, as well as the context in which alcohol consumption occurs. Some groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences. Societal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies. The impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking.",

The impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking. Most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption. The context plays an important role in the occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly as a result of alcohol intoxication. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on their outcomes and how these evolve over time. There are gender differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. In 2019, 52% of men were current drinkers, while only 35% of women had been drinking alcohol in the last 12 months. Alcohol per capita consumption was, on average, 8.2 litres for men compared to 2.2 litres for women. In 2019, alcohol use was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths among men and 2.4% of all deaths among women. WHO response The Global alcohol action plan 2022–2030, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective, evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination, technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and information systems, and resource mobilization. Implementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. Achieving this will require global, regional and national actions on the levels, patterns and contexts of alcohol consumption and the wider social determinants of health, with a particular focus on implementing high-impact cost effective interventions. It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures.

It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need. The SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption. The WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world. Achieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance. Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence. Engaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. By working together, with due diligence and protection from conflicts of interest, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be effectively reduced.

    "text": "Road traffic injuries Key facts Approximately 1.19 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. 92% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have around 60% of the world's vehicles. More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. The United Nations General Assembly has set an ambitious target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030 (A/RES/74/299). Overview Every year the lives of approximately 1.19 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Who is at risk? Socioeconomic status More than 90% of road traffic deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Road traffic death rates are highest in the WHO African Region and lowest in the European Region. Even within high-income countries, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes. Age Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. Two thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working age (18–59 years), Sex Males are typically 3 times more likely to be killed in road crashes than females. Risk factors The safe system approach: accommodating human error Transport systems should be responsive to the needs of users and forgiving of human error. The safe system approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users.

The safe system approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users. This approach takes into account people’s vulnerability to serious injuries and recognizes that the system should be designed to accommodate human error. The cornerstones of this approach are safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe road users, all of which must be addressed in order to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injuries. Speeding An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65 km/h). In car-to-car side impacts the fatality risk for car occupants is 85% at 65 km/h. Driving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances Driving under the influence of alcohol and any psychoactive substance or drug increases the risk of a crash that results in death or serious injuries. In the case of drink-driving, the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver's BAC is ≥ 0.04 g/dl. In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of a fatal crash occurring among those who have used amphetamines is about 5 times the risk of someone who hasn't. Non-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints Correct helmet use can reduce the risk of death in a crash by more than 6 times and the risk of brain injury by up to 74%. Wearing a seat-belt can reduce the risk of death among vehicle occupants by up to 50%. The use of child restraints can lead to a 71% reduction in deaths among infants.

The use of child restraints can lead to a 71% reduction in deaths among infants. Distracted driving There are many types of distractions that can lead to impaired driving. The distraction caused by mobile phones is a growing concern for road safety. Drivers using mobile phones are approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers not using a mobile phone. Using a phone while driving slows reaction times (notably braking reaction time, but also reaction to traffic signals), and makes it difficult to keep in the correct lane, and to keep the correct following distances. Hands-free phones are not much safer than hand-held phone sets. Texting considerably increases the risk of a crash. Unsafe road infrastructure The design of roads can have a considerable impact on their safety. Ideally, roads should be designed keeping in mind the safety of all road users. This would mean making sure that there are adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points and other traffic calming measures can be critical to reducing the risk of injury among these road users. Unsafe vehicles Safe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries’ manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries – both to those in the vehicle and those out of it – is considerably increased. Inadequate post-crash care Delays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic crash increase the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after a crash has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: delays of minutes can make the difference between life and death. Improving post-crash care requires ensuring access to timely prehospital care, and improving the quality of both prehospital and hospital care, such as through specialist training programmes.

Inadequate law enforcement of traffic laws If traffic laws on drink-driving, seat-belt wearing, speed limits, helmets and child restraints are not enforced, they cannot bring about the expected reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries related to specific behaviours. Thus, if traffic laws are not enforced or are perceived as not being enforced, it is likely they will not be complied with and therefore will have very little chance of influencing behaviour. Effective enforcement includes establishing, regularly updating, and enforcing laws at the national, municipal, and local levels that address the above mentioned risk factors. It includes also the definition of appropriate penalties. Prevention Road traffic injuries can be prevented. Governments must take action to address road safety in a holistic manner. This requires involvement from multiple sectors such as transport, police, health and education, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations. It requires actions that address the safety of roads, vehicles and all road users. Effective interventions include designing safer infrastructure and incorporating road safety features into land-use and transport planning, improving the safety features of vehicles; enhancing post-crash care for victims of road traffic crashes; setting and enforcing laws relating to key risks, and raising public awareness. WHO response WHO works with Member States and partners across sectors to support road safety evaluation, implementation and planning. As the lead agency for road safety in the United Nations, WHO plays a key role in guiding global efforts by advocating for road safety at the highest levels, compiling and sharing good practices and raising awareness of road safety. WHO serves as the secretariat for the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–2030, which aims to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by at least 50% by 2030. This includes convening a global network of heads of national road safety agencies, producing global status reports to track progress, and providing technical assistance. WHO works with a range of partners to provide technical support to countries.

    "text": "Noncommunicable diseases Key facts Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) killed at least 43 million people in 2021, equivalent to 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths globally. In 2021, 18 million people died from an NCD before age 70 years; 82% of these premature deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Of all NCD deaths, 73% are in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or at least 19 million deaths in 2021, followed by cancers (10 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (over 2 million including kidney disease deaths caused by diabetes). These four groups of diseases account for 80% of all premature NCD deaths. Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution all increase the risk of dying from an NCD. Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs. Overview Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where nearly three quarters of global NCD deaths (32 million) occur. People at risk People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs. These conditions are often associated with older age groups, but about 18 million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 years. NCDs cause more deaths in this age group than all other causes of death combined. Of these premature deaths, 82% are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors contributing to NCDs, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke, or the harmful use of alcohol or air pollution. Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity.

Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called metabolic risk factors and can lead to cardiovascular disease, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths. Risk factors Behavioural risk factors Behavioural risk factors increase the risk of NCDS, including: tobacco use (including the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke); unhealthy diets, including excess salt, sugar, and fats; harmful use of alcohol; and insufficient physical activity. The social, commercial, and physical environment are key drivers of these behaviours. Metabolic risk factors Behavioural risk factors contribute to four key metabolic changes that increase the risk of NCDs: raised blood pressure (including hypertension); overweight/obesity; high blood glucose levels (including diabetes); and abnormal blood lipids (including high cholesterol). In terms of attributable deaths, the leading metabolic risk factor globally is elevated blood pressure (to which 25% of global NCD deaths are attributed) (1), followed by raised blood glucose and overweight and obesity. Environmental risk factors Several environmental risk factors contribute to NCDs. Air pollution – indoor and outdoor – is the largest of these, accounting for 6.7 million deaths globally, of which about 5.6 million are due to NCDs, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Socioeconomic impact NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target of reducing the probability of death from any of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 years by one third by 2030. Poverty is closely linked with NCDs. The rapid rise in NCDs is predicted to impede poverty reduction initiatives in low-income countries, particularly by increasing household costs associated with health care. Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than people of higher socio-economic positions, especially because they may have limited access to health services.

To reduce these inequities, governments must invest in health systems that respond to users’ expectations and needs. Prevention and control An important way to control NCDs is to focus on reducing the risk factors associated with these diseases. Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities. To lessen the impact of NCDs on individuals and society, a comprehensive approach is needed requiring all sectors, including health, finance, transport, education, agriculture, planning and others, to collaborate to reduce the risks associated with NCDs, and to promote interventions to prevent and control them. Investing in better management of NCDs is critical. Management of NCDs includes detecting, screening and treating these diseases, and providing access to palliative care for people in need. High impact essential NCD interventions can be delivered through a primary health care approach to strengthen early detection and timely treatment. Evidence shows such interventions are excellent economic investments because, if provided early to patients, they can reduce the need for more expensive treatment. Countries with inadequate health care coverage are unlikely to provide universal access to essential NCD interventions. NCD management interventions are essential for achieving the SDG target on NCDs. WHO response The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development. As part of the Agenda, heads of state and government committed to develop ambitious national responses, by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment (SDG target 3.4). WHO plays a key leadership role in the coordination and promotion of the global fight against NCDs and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4. In 2019, the World Health Assembly extended the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020 to 2030 and called for the development of an Implementation Roadmap 2023 to 2030 to accelerate progress on preventing and controlling NCDs.

The adopted resolution and endorsed strategy gives guidance to both Member States and to the WHO Secretariat on ways to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The vision behind the global strategy is improved health and social outcomes for individuals, families and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The global strategy aims to give guidance for action at all levels; to set priority areas for global action; and to recommend a portfolio of policy options and measures that could be considered for implementation and adjusted as appropriate at the national level, taking into account national circumstances, such as religious and cultural contexts, national public health priorities, as well as resources, capacities and capabilities.

WHO supports Member States in developing comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services delivered through community platforms. Among the priority actions are determining the optimal mix of services, building capacity among non-specialist health workers to deliver essential mental health care, advocating for a recovery-oriented model of care, scaling-up low intensity psychological interventions, innovating through digital health, and integrating mental health into universal health coverage (UHC) and primary health care (PHC). The mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s flagship programme for mental health services to support scale-up care for priority mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialized settings. Community workers and health care providers who are affiliated with primary, secondary and tertiary health care services can be trained in using scalable psychological interventions to bridge the gap in availability of evidence-based psychological services.

As part of the effort to prevent and control NCDs, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office promotes the idea that people can be healthier when they make healthier decisions. Insufficient physical activity contributes to 3.2 million deaths and 69.3 million disability-adjusted life-years each year. In 2003, WHO launched the annual “Move for Health” day as a global initiative to promote the benefits of physical activity in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer. One out of two people live in cities in the Western Pacific Region, and many countries continue to go through the process of rapid urbanization. For all the benefits that living in an urban environment brings to citizens, cities also have the potential to contribute to the NCD epidemic. WHO Western Pacific Office supports the process of healthy urbanization through various initiatives. Since 2004, every two years WHO Western Pacific Regional Office recognizes outstanding work in selected areas to encourage cities in the Region to continue to innovate and demonstrate effective and efficient ways of promoting and protecting health of urban populations.

WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports Member States in the prevention and control of NCDs to: Raise priority accorded to NCDs through international cooperation and advocacy. Strengthen national capacity, governance, multisectoral action, and partnerships. Reduce the major modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity. Develop and implement effective legal frameworks. Orient health systems through people-centred health care and universal health coverage. Promote high-quality research and development. Monitor trends, determinants and progress to achieve global, regional and national targets through evidence-based interventions. The Regional Office’s work is guided by the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific, which delineates the regional vision, guiding principles, objectives and recommended actions to counter and reverse the growing burden of NCDs. This Regional Action Framework is aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2030 and regional action frameworks that can work together to create a united vision for health in the Western Pacific Region. The regional action plan recognizes that many of the most effective actions necessary to tackle the NCD burden lie outside the health sector. Policies in sectors responsible for education, trade, food, alcohol and urban development need to be as much part of the action on NCDs as the responses from the health sector. A health-in-all-policies approach will increasingly play an important role in rendering visibility to the need for dialogue and consensus on the impact of policies on health in general and the NCD epidemic in particular.

Alcohol is one of the biggest risk factors for deaths among young people in the Region. Young people are especially at risk for alcohol-related injury (e.g. drink-driving), risky sexual behaviour and suicide. \"One in three current drinkers in the Western Pacific aged 15 to 19 has engaged in excessive drinking,\" notes Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. \"Alcohol abuse is associated with depression and anxiety. Excessive drinking is closely linked to self-harm and suicide.\" Young people often underestimate the risks associated with excessive use of alcohol and potentially impaired decision-making. Under the influence of alcohol, they are at higher risk of injury from drink-driving and violence. A driver under the age of 20 with blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 g/dl is 5 times more likely to be involved in a crash than older more experienced drivers. Road crashes involving young people are also more likely to be fatal. Studies have shown that between 48-61% of fatalities among pedestrians are linked to alcohol. Globally, across all age groups, alcohol is estimated to be responsible for 26% and 16% of years of life lost from homicide among males and females respectively. In the general population, alcohol and other substance use disorders are found in 25–50% of all suicides. The risk is further increased when it coexists with depression and other psychiatric illness. Of all deaths from suicide, 22% can be attributed to the use of alcohol. Alcohol consumption can increase the likelihood of young people engaging in risky behaviours such as unsafe sex. The risk of unwanted pregnancies is 14 times greater without modern contraception. Continued drinking while pregnant increases the risk of complications such as premature birth and fetal alcohol syndrome. Unsafe sex also contributes to sexually transmitted infections including the risk of contracting HIV. Regular recreational drinking during adolescence is the clearest predictor of alcohol dependence in adulthood. Over time it increases the risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and liver cirrhosis. These consequences impose significant direct costs to society such as health care related expenses. Indirect costs from lost productivity due to absenteeism, unemployment, decreased output, reduced earnings potential and lost working years due to premature pension or death account for as high as 76–91% of the total burden to society.

Indirect costs from lost productivity due to absenteeism, unemployment, decreased output, reduced earnings potential and lost working years due to premature pension or death account for as high as 76–91% of the total burden to society. We can protect young people from the harmful use of alcohol In 2014 at the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on NCDs, Member States pledged to intensify efforts to prevent the needless loss of life from NCDs. This includes setting national targets by 2025 to reduce risk factors and underlying social determinants. The nine voluntary NCD targets include a 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol. Regulations regarding the availability of alcohol, comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising and promotions, and price increases through taxation are cost-effective interventions to address this threat to public health. It is estimated that doubling the tax on alcohol would decrease the number of alcohol-related deaths by 35%, traffic deaths by 11% and sexually transmitted infections by 6%. Added revenue from alcohol tax may also be used to fund health promotion activities. Young people can be powerful agents of change. Across the different social media platforms, between 24-57% of active users are aged 16–24. Social media provides a space for discussion and advocacy for measures to protect themselves. Youth networks and community forums are other tools young people can use to make their voices heard. Advocacy to key stakeholders (e.g. families, educators and policy-makers) is crucial to raise awareness and political commitment for the development of evidence-based policies that reduce alcohol consumption. Health workers can educate and screen young people for problematic behaviour and provide brief intervention and referral at the primary-care level. Integrated care programmes incorporating counselling, rehabilitation and detoxification are more effective than standalone approaches. Media Contacts Mr Ruel E.

Lkhagvasuren Two related United Nations missions visited Mongolia from 7-11 September to support the government in reducing premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), a country where the probability of premature death is 32%. Mongolia became the second country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to receive the Joint Mission of the UN Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. The mission included representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The second mission led by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Secretariat and the Ministry of Health and Sports conducted a needs assessment for the implementation of the FCTC. During the visit, mission members met central and local government representatives, the Head of the President’s Secretariat, the Senior Advisor on Health to the Parliament Speaker, health officials from the capital city and its districts, members of scientific and professional associations and civil society. The missions concluded that the epidemic of NCDs, principally cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, is now a serious concern in Mongolia. Half of adult males in the country are tobacco smokers. One out of three people have raised blood pressure, and one out of five have diabetes. They also found that the main risk factors for NCDs in Mongolia are tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. “Usually one or the other of the four risk factors are found to be prevalent in a given country. But Mongolia is unique with all four risk factors on the rise,” says Dr Nick Banatvala from WHO in Geneva. The Joint Mission welcomed the Second National Programme on Prevention and Control of Diseases Caused by Unhealthy Lifestyles 2014-2021 for setting out an approach for all parts of government to work together to combat the NCDs epidemic. However it also advised that the Programme could be strengthened by prioritizing actions on NCDs prevention and control and costing such actions.

Overall the experts mentioned that coordination mechanisms within the government and accountability at the political level should be improved. “One conclusion of a recent review of progress in Mongolia carried out for WHO NCD Progress Monitor 2015 is that action implementing cost-effective policies to reduce NCD risk factors needs to be stepped up,” says Dr Banatvala. “The government recognizes that it cannot manage the ever-increasing burden of NCDs by treating people with these conditions and, therefore, prevention is now the first priority,” says G. Shiilegdamba, the Minister of Health and Sports of Mongolia, stressing the importance of further collaboration with the UN agencies on reduction of NCDs. “A whole-of-government, whole-of-society is now required to tackle the four main NCD risk factors,” says Dudley Tarlton, the programme specialist with the UNDP office in Geneva. “This requires a whole-of-UN response to help the government in building national NCD solutions”, he added. “There are a number of inspirational activities and projects on NCD prevention that the province and city district governments had been undertaking,” says Ch. Tsendsuren, the Chair of the Darkhan-Uul province’s local parliament. He brings an example of the “Healthy City” programme initiated by the Darkhan city mayor in 1996-2012 with further extension to 2015 that aimed at creating healthy living environments in urban and rural areas of the province and promotion of healthy lifestyles in communities, families, and for individuals. The FCTC implementation assessment mission applauded the comprehensive revisions made to the law on tobacco control by Mongolia in 2013 which was first adopted soon after Mongolia’s ratification of the FCTC in 2003. Currently, smoking is prohibited in many public places such as schools and restaurants, and advertising of tobacco is banned. Sale of tobacco is also banned within 500 metres of secondary schools and student dormitories.

However, the mission also pointed at the missing parts of the law implementation, as accessibility and availability of tobacco products and the lack of health promotion. A further revision of the law in 2015 allowed designated smoking areas in public places, which eroded gains being made in tobacco control in the country. “The tobacco industry is an experienced and powerful enemy that uses all possible means to keep people smoking,” says Dr Carmen Maria Audera-Lopez of the FCTC Secretariat.” So the law should be combined with strong and continued health promotion efforts to inform people about the harm from smoking and second-hand smoke.” The FCTC mission advised Mongolian authorities to re-establish the suspended Health Promotion Foundation, which was funded by 2% of excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and to then channel the resources to the public health sector including health promotion. “Both the prices of and taxes on alcohol and tobacco are very low in Mongolia in comparison with other countries,” says parliamentarian L. Erdenechimeg, the initiator of the 2013 comprehensive revisions to the Tobacco Control Law and the Chair of the Women’s Caucus in the parliament. “Hence we will push for re-establishing the Health Promotion Foundation during the upcoming discussion of the next year’s budget.” She stressed the need to make high-level decisions on alcohol and tobacco control and bring necessary changes to the Law. WHO’s Representative to Mongolia, Dr Soe Nyunt U, says important developments that can improve the NCD situation in this country, are in place including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, and the new UN Development Action Framework being drawn up by UN organizations in Mongolia to support development, including health, for 2017-2021. “The SDGs, Goal 3 specifically, aim to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of all people at all ages.

In many of today’s societies, alcoholic beverages are a routine part of the social landscape for many in the population. This is particularly true for those in social environments with high visibility and societal influence, nationally and internationally, where alcohol frequently accompanies socializing. In this context, it is easy to overlook or discount the health and social damage caused or contributed to by drinking. Alcohol consumption contributes to 2.6 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 4.7% of the global burden of disease. Harmful use of alcohol is accountable for 6,9 % and 2.0% of the global burden of disease for males and females respectively. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature mortality and disability among those aged 20 to 39 years, accounting for 13% of all deaths in this age group. Disadvantaged and especially vulnerable populations have higher rates of alcohol-related death and hospitalization. Alcohol as an intoxicant affects a wide range of structures and processes in the central nervous system and increases the risk for intentional and unintentional injuries and adverse social consequences. Alcohol has considerable toxic effects on the digestive and cardiovascular systems. Alcoholic beverages are classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and increase the risk of several cancer types. Alcohol as an immunosuppressant increases the risk of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and HIV. Both the volume of lifetime alcohol use and a combination of context, frequency of alcohol consumption and amount consumed per occasion increase the risk of the wide range of health and social harms. The risks increase largely in a dose-dependent manner with the volume of alcohol consumed and with frequency of drinking, and exponentially with the amount consumed on a single occasion. Surrogate and illegally produced alcohols can bring an extra health risk from toxic contaminants. Since any alcohol use is associated with some short-term and long-term health risks, it is difficult to define universally applicable population-based thresholds for low-risk drinking. WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol as a public health priority. The 2010 WHO Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the 2022 WHO Global action plan are the most comprehensive international alcohol policy documents, endorsed by WHO Member States, that provides guidance on reducing the harmful use of alcohol at all levels.

The 2010 WHO Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the 2022 WHO Global action plan are the most comprehensive international alcohol policy documents, endorsed by WHO Member States, that provides guidance on reducing the harmful use of alcohol at all levels. WHO’s approach aligns with and furthers work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically target 3.5 on substance abuse, including harmful use of alcohol, and target 3.4 on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and promoting mental health and well-being. WHO has identified that the most cost-effective actions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol include increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, enforcing restrictions on exposure to alcohol advertising, and restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol. In addition, enforcing drink driving countermeasures and securing access to screening, brief interventions, and treatment are effective and ethically sound interventions. The most cost-effective interventions are at the focus of WHO-led SAFER initiative aimed at providing support for Member States in reducing the harmful use of alcohol. WHO’s work provides special attention to reducing harm to people other than the drinker and to populations that are at particular risk from harmful use of alcohol, such as children, adolescents, women of child-bearing age, pregnant and breastfeeding women, indigenous people and other minority groups or groups with low socioeconomic status.

WHO and the UN regional commissions, in cooperation with other partners in the UN Road Safety Collaboration, have developed a Global Plan for the Decade of Action, which was released in October 2021. The Global Plan aligns with the Stockholm Declaration, by emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to road safety, and calling on continued improvements in the design of roads and vehicles; enhancement of laws and law enforcement; and provision of timely, life-saving emergency care for the injured. The Global Plan also reflects the Stockholm Declaration’s promotion of policies to promote walking, cycling and using public transport as inherently healthy and environmentally sound modes of transport. Progress made during the previous Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 has laid the foundation for accelerated action in the years ahead. Among achievements are inclusion of road safety on the global health and development agenda, broad dissemination of scientific guidance on what works, strengthening of partnerships and networks, and mobilization of resources. This new Decade of Action provides an opportunity for harnessing the successes and lessons of previous years and building upon them to save more lives.

During the same period of time, the total alcohol per-capita consumption in the Region increased from 4.8 litres to 7.3 litres, surpassing the global average by almost 10%. The volume of alcohol consumed and patterns of consumption vary substantially between countries and areas. The greatest levels of alcohol consumption occur in high-income countries, with a slight and sustained decrease in alcohol consumption over the past decade. Over the last two decades, alcohol consumption has dramatically increased in low- and middle-income countries and areas. Consumption of alcohol is a preventable risk factor that can cause premature death and over 200 diseases including 7 types of cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cirrhosis of the liver and several infectious diseases. In addition to its risk to noncommunicable diseases, alcohol use has been identified as an important risk factor for different types of injury including road traffic injuries, drowning, fall and violence. Globally, an estimated 900 000 injury deaths in 2016 were attributable to alcohol, including around 41% of deaths due to road injuries, 17% due to self-harm and around 10% due to interpersonal violence.

    "text": "Antimicrobial resistance Key facts Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats. It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths (1) . The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected. AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. In addition to death and disability, AMR has significant economic costs. The World Bank estimates that AMR could result in US$ 1 trillion additional healthcare costs by 2050, and US$ 1 trillion to US$ 3.4 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) losses per year by 2030 (2) . Priorities to address AMR in human health include preventing all infections, which may result in inappropriate use of antimicrobials; ensuring universal access to quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; and strategic information and innovation, for example surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption/use, and research and development for novel vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. Overview Antimicrobials – including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics – are medicines used to prevent and treat infectious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death. AMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control",

AMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control infections in humans, animals and plants. A global concern Antimicrobial medicines are the cornerstone of modern medicine. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens threatens our ability to treat common infections and to perform life-saving procedures including cancer chemotherapy and caesarean section, hip replacements, organ transplantation and other surgeries. In addition, drug-resistant infections impact the health of animals and plants, reduce productivity in farms, and threaten food security. AMR has significant costs for both health systems and national economies overall. For example, it creates need for more expensive and intensive care, affects productivity of patients or their caregivers through prolonged hospital stays, and harms agricultural productivity. AMR is a problem for all countries at all income levels. Its spread does not recognize country borders. Contributing factors include lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and control in homes, healthcare facilities and farms; poor access to quality and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and medicines; lack of awareness and knowledge; and lack of enforcement of relevant legislation. People living in low-resource settings and vulnerable populations are especially impacted by both the drivers and consequences of AMR. What is the present situation? Drug-resistance in bacteria The global rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the efficacy of common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. The 2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report highlights alarming resistance rates among prevalent bacterial pathogens. Median reported rates in 76 countries of 42% for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and 35% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a major concern. For urinary tract infections caused by E. coli , 1 in 5 cases exhibited reduced susceptibility to standard antibiotics like ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones in 2020.

This is making it harder to effectively treat common infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae , a common intestinal bacterium, also showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics. Increased levels of resistance potentially lead to heightened utilization of last-resort drugs like carbapenems, for which resistance is in turn being observed across multiple regions. As the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs is compromised, the risks increase of infections that cannot be treated. Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate an anticipated twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide. Drug resistance in fungi As drug-resistant fungal infections increase, WHO is monitoring their magnitude and public health impact. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat, including due to drug-drug interactions for patients with other infections (e.g. HIV). The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant Candida auris , an invasive fungal infection, is of particular concern. Development of WHO’s Fungal Priority Pathogens List (see below) included a comprehensive review of fungal infections and drug-resistant fungi globally. Drug resistance in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is caused by changes in the HIV genome that affect the ability of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to block the replication of the virus. HIVDR can either be transmitted at the time of infection or acquired because of inadequate adherence to treatment or drug-drug interactions. HIVDR can lead to increased HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends that countries routinely implement HIVDR surveys to inform the selection of optimal ARV drug regimens for HIV prevention and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB",

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs, but these medicines are expensive and toxic, and in some cases more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options. MDR-TB is therefore a public health crisis and threat to health security. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022. The emergence of drug-resistant parasites is a major threat to malaria control. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and are used by most malaria endemic countries. Emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin and/or partner drugs in ACTs makes selecting the right treatment more challenging and requires close monitoring. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, partial resistance to artemisinin or a partner drug has been confirmed in several countries since 2001. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, resistance to a partner drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, led in some countries to treatment failure requiring a change to another ACT. In Africa, mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance have been observed in several countries. ACTs that have been tested remain efficacious, but further spread of resistance could be a major public health challenge and improved surveillance is vital. Drug resistance in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) The emergence of drug resistance against medicines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a significant threat to programmes to control, eliminate and eradicate NTDs, which especially affect vulnerable and marginalized populations.

It is important to monitor resistance and drug efficacy, put in place strategies to delay or curb resistance, and strengthen the pipeline of second-line medicines for NTDs. For example, WHO provides guidance for surveillance of resistance for the global leprosy elimination programme, and support to control distribution and monitor the standardized use, safety and efficacy of medicines, including donated medicines, in NTD programmes. Coordinated global action to address AMR One Health approach AMR is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors. One Health refers to an integrated, unifying approach that aims to achieve optimal and sustainable health outcomes for people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment are closely linked and inter-dependent. The One Health approach to preventing and controlling AMR brings together stakeholders from relevant sectors to communicate and work together in the design, implementation and monitoring of programmes, policies, legislation and research to mitigate AMR and attain better health and economic outcomes. Global Action Plan (GAP) on Antimicrobial Resistance To address AMR globally, countries adopted the Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR during the 2015 World Health Assembly and committed to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans with a One Health approach to tackle AMR.

Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on Antimicrobial Resistance To coordinate the One Health global response to AMR, WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The 4 organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH) are known as the Quadripartite. A quadripartite joint secretariat is hosted by WHO to drive multi-stakeholder engagement in AMR. This has supported establishment of the Global Leaders Group on AMR , which began its work in November 2020, and the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform , which was launched in November 2022, and several technical working groups. High-level meetings on AMR In March 2022, United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/76/257 established a second High-level Meeting on AMR to be held in 2024, in collaboration with the Quadripartite Organizations and with the support of the Global Leaders Group. In October 2023, The President of the General Assembly appointed the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Malta to co-facilitate the high-level meeting. The high-level meeting is an important opportunity for countries to make ambitious commitments and agree targets, and the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat is working closely with the co-facilitators and Global Leaders Group to ensure optimal participation and inputs from the human, animal, agri-food and the environment sectors. In addition, three Global High-level Ministerial Conferences on AMR, in the Netherlands in 2014 and 2019, and in Oman in 2022, led to the Global Action Plan, the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund , and groundbreaking multisectoral AMR targets.

World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) is a global campaign to raise awareness, understanding and best practices with the public, One Health stakeholders, and other policymakers. One of WHO’s official health campaigns since 2015, WAAW is celebrated from 18 to 24 November every year. A programmatic response to AMR in countries AMR national action plans As of November 2023, 178 countries had developed AMR national action plans aligned with the GAP. To ensure sustained progress, countries need to establish a functioning multisectoral AMR governance mechanism, prioritize activities, develop a costed operational plan, mobilize resources (both domestic and external), and effectively implement their plan. Monitoring mechanisms are needed to track progress, identify challenges and report periodically. To globally track the progress in AMR national action plan implementation, countries have committed to completing the multisectoral annual Tracking AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS) that was launched in 2016 with results published at https://www.amrcountryprogress.org/ . The people-centred approach and WHO core package of interventions To address AMR in a programmatic manner that puts people, their needs and equitable access to health services at the centre of the AMR response in the community, in primary care, secondary and tertiary care, and at national and/or subnational level, WHO has developed the People-centred approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance in human health and WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans. This focuses on preventing infections and ensuring universal access to health services for quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment. As a crucial part of their AMR response, countries can integrate the core package of AMR interventions in national plans and strategies for universal health coverage and health emergency preparedness and response.

Antimicrobial stewardship and AWaRe Antimicrobial stewardship is a systematic approach to educate and support health care professionals to follow evidence-based guidelines for prescribing and administering antimicrobials. The education of the health workforce is of crucial importance, as they form the front line in safeguarding the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines. WHO guides countries to develop and implement Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes as one of the most cost-effective interventions to optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines, improve patient outcomes and reduce AMR and health care-associated infections. To improve access to appropriate treatment and reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics, WHO developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics. The WHO AWaRe antibiotic book provides concise, evidence-based guidance on the choice of antibiotic, dose, route of administration, and duration of treatment for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings. Strategic information to inform the AMR response WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) in 2015 to fill knowledge gaps and inform strategies at all levels. GLASS progressively incorporates data from surveillance of AMR in humans, surveillance of the use and consumption of antimicrobials, and integrated AMR data in the One Health sectors including the food chain and in the environment. GLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries, territories and areas. It also monitors the status of existing and new national surveillance systems, with emphasis on representativeness and quality of data collection. Some WHO regions have established surveillance networks that provide technical support to countries and facilitate enrollment into GLASS. WHO is committed especially to supporting low- and middle-income countries to improve data collection and usage for policymaking, both through GLASS and by supporting nationally representative AMR prevalence surveys .

WHO’s latest annual review of the pre-clinical and clinical antibacterial pipelines identified 27 antibiotics in clinical development that address WHO bacterial priority pathogens, of which only 6 were classified as innovative. In addition, a lack of access to quality antimicrobials and shortages of generic off-patent antibiotics affect countries across all levels of income and development. To guide research and development into new antimicrobials, diagnostics and vaccines, and inform public health action, WHO developed the first WHO bacterial priority pathogens list in 2017 and updated this in 2023 (publication forthcoming), and published the WHO fungal priority pathogen list in 2022. To help fill the major gaps in R&D for antimicrobials, vaccines and diagnostic tools, WHO works closely with organizations such as the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP), the AMR Action Fund, and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). Various governments are also piloting different models to incentivize research and development of newer antimicrobials to ultimately ensure access to treatment. Greater innovation and investment are also required in epidemiological and operational research.

    "text": "Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to human health with significant global economic and security implications. In 2015, WHO Member States unanimously approved a Global Action Plan to tackle AMR (GAP-AMR). The goal of GAP-AMR is “to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them”. Surveillance is an essential tool to inform policies and infection prevention and control responses. Importantly, it is the cornerstone for assessing the spread of AMR and to inform and monitor the impact of local, national and global strategies. On 22 October 2015, WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) , the first global collaborative effort to standardize AMR surveillance. Endorsed by the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in resolution WHA68.7, GLASS was created to support the second objective of the GAP-AMR initiative to “strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research”, and to continue filling knowledge gaps, with the aim to inform strategies at all levels. SCOPE GLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries and seeks to actively support capacity building and monitor the status of existing and new national surveillance systems. Furthermore, GLASS promotes a shift from surveillance approaches based solely on laboratory data to a system that includes epidemiological, clinical, and population-level data . GLASS has been conceived to progressively incorporate data from surveillance of AMR in humans, such as monitoring of resistance and the use of antimicrobial medicines, including AMR in the food chain and in the environment. STRUCTURE The various types of AMR-related surveillance activities led by GLASS are grouped into a series of technical modules . These modules comprise surveillance activities built on routinely-available data (for example, patient samples collected for clinical purposes or national sales of antimicrobials) and focused activities targeted at generating information for specific purposes, based on the needs of countries and regions. GLASS is also engaged in the design and implementation of surveys and studies aimed at helping countries to achieve a better quality and representativeness of their data.

It serves as a common environment for data submission for several technical modules (GLASS-AMR, GLASS-AMC, GLASS-FUNGI, EGASP) and supports the implementation of One Health AMR surveillance at national level. The GLASS IT Platform is also intended to facilitate future integrated analyses between AMC and AMR data at national, regional and global levels. WHONET GLASS IT TOOLS WHONET is a free desktop Windows application for the management and analysis of microbiology laboratory data, with a particular focus on AMR surveillance, developed and supported by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). WHONET is available in 28 languages and supports local, national, regional, and global surveillance efforts in more than 2300 hospital, public health, animal health and food laboratories in over 130 countries worldwide. Laboratory Strenghthening GLASS and WHO Collaborating Centres are working on building national laboratory capacities in countries through a range of activities. Laboratory-based diagnostic tests for AMR usually involve the laboratory identification of the infectious organism, its drug susceptibility, and sometimes serology testing and molecular analyses. Increased laboratory capacity and rapid, accurate diagnostic testing in countries would significantly impact on global AMR surveillance and diagnostic stewardship. Diagnostic stewardship is defined as including the various stages of the diagnostic process in clinical microbiology and laboratory management. GLASS and WHO Collaborating Centres will provide technical support to countries for the development and operation of national reference laboratories, such as external quality assurance, quality management, continuous training for the performance of AMR testing, as well as for the reporting",

Several tools are listed below to support laboratory functions. Additional tools are currently under development by GLASS to support the strengthening of national reference laboratories in resource-limited settings. GLASS Partnerships CAESAR CAESAR is a joint initiative of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). It consists of a network of national AMR surveillance systems coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm (Sweden) and includes all countries of the WHO European Region that are not part of EARS-Net. EARS-Net EARS-Net is the largest publicly-funded system for AMR surveillance in Europe. It is managed and coordinated by ECDC, supported by a coordination committee composed of experts selected from the appointed disease-specific contact points. EARS-Net is based on routine clinical antimicrobial susceptibility data from local and clinical laboratories reported to ECDC by appointed representatives from WHO Member States. Data originate from national AMR surveillance initiatives and/or laboratory networks. Only data from invasive isolates (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) are included. ReLAVRA In 1996, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO launched ReLAVRA, the Latin American Network for AMR Surveillance, which aims at reporting the magnitude and trends of AMR in the region using routine data from microbiology laboratories.
