        "title": "Ageing and health WPRO",
        "content": "The Western Pacific Region has one of the largest and fastest growing older population in the world. There are more than 245 million people aged 65 years and older in the Western Pacific Region and this number is expected to double by 2050. Population ageing has significant societal implications, including an increase in burden of NCDs as well as a growing population of people with diverse functional abilities. Supporting healthy ageing requires a long-term, whole-of-society approach. Specifically, health system transformation is needed to accompany people throughout their life, placing a greater emphasis on preventative health and addressing the social determinants of health. Communities also need to be strengthened to provide integrated services and supports to older adults that are tailored to individual needs. Population ageing also offers many opportunities for individuals and society as a whole. People are living longer, enabling them to engage in a wider range of activities and interests that are meaningful to them across their lifetime. The growing older population is also better educated and more knowledgeable than ever before, enabling them to offer greater contributions to society. However, to fully realize these opportunities, a change in narrative is needed from one that views older adults as societal burdens to recognizing the many valuable contributions they can make to society when they are supported and encouraged to do so. The rapidly population ageing population in the Western Pacific Region has widespread implications for health, wellbeing, and the general organization of societies. It increases demand for primary health care and long-term care, requires a larger and better trained health workforce, increases the need for physical and social environments to be made more age-friendly, and calls for actions to tackle ageism. Turning challenges into opportunities by investing in healthy ageing through health promotion, prevention, quality healthcare, age-friendly policies and transformations is therefore paramount. It can yield significant benefits for individuals and society in general. Older adults contribute to society in a variety of ways including through paid and unpaid work, as caregivers for family members, and passing down knowledge and traditions to younger generations. They also contribute to the economy as employees, consumers, investors, and social service providers. The World Health Organization is committed to supporting Member States and ensuring positive impact on communities across the Western Pacific Region in fulfilling this vision of older people living longer and healthier lives for the benefit of all. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States, UN agencies and diverse stakeholders from various sectors to improve the health and well-being of older populations in the Region so that they thrive and contribute in society. WHO does this work in the Region through the Regional Action Plan on Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific , which advocates for a whole-of-society transformation, beyond health systems. Adding years to life can offer individuals and society new opportunities, but only if society encourages and enables older people to remain healthy and to continue participating and thriving. Working with Member States, the Regional Action Plan outlines five objectives for achieving the vision of healthy ageing in the Western Pacific Region: Transform societies as a whole to promote healthy ageing. Transform health systems to address each individual’s lifelong health needs by providing necessary health and non-health services in a coordinated way. Provide community-based integrated care for older adults tailored to individual needs. Fostering technological and social innovation to promote healthy ageing. Strengthen monitoring and surveillance systems and research on older adults to inform programmes, services and policies. WHO continues to support countries to operationalize this Regional Action Plan, to provide tools, knowledge and information-sharing platforms, and to advocate to prevent and counteract negative stereotypes about ageing.

        "title": "Air pollution WPRO",
        "content": "Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risk to health. Air pollution leads people to be exposed to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections. WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants , with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. Both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution are responsible for about 7 million deaths globally per year; in the Western Pacific Region alone, around 2.2 million people die each year. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change. The Western Pacific Region bears the greatest share of deaths due to air pollution globally. Every 14 seconds a person dies as a result of air pollution in the Region. Children – especially those in low-income countries with fewer resources to mitigate the health impacts – are among the most at risk. Older people are also especially vulnerable to respiratory and other diseases caused by air pollution and aeroallergens. Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution. Under the For the Future vision for making the Western Pacific the healthiest and safest region, WHO supports countries in the Region to develop narratives and arguments about the relationship between climate change, environmental degradation and health, including air pollution, in order to advocate for action at the highest political level. WHO also monitors the health impacts air pollution and climate change on health; and provides technical support to Member States in the development of normative guidance, tools and provision of authoritative advice on health issues related to air pollution and its sources. WHO works to ensure national climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies – and environmental health action plans – prioritize health sector resilience to climate and environmental change, and are able to mitigate the health impact.

        "title": "Alcohol WPRO",
        "content": "Globally, the Western Pacific Region has some of the highest alcohol consumption among adults. Between 2000-2016, the percentage of drinkers increased in the Western Pacific. During the same period of time, the total alcohol per-capita consumption in the Region increased from 4.8 litres to 7.3 litres, surpassing the global average by almost 10%. The volume of alcohol consumed and patterns of consumption vary substantially between countries and areas. The greatest levels of alcohol consumption occur in high-income countries, with a slight and sustained decrease in alcohol consumption over the past decade. Over the last two decades, alcohol consumption has dramatically increased in low- and middle-income countries and areas. Consumption of alcohol is a preventable risk factor that can cause premature death and over 200 diseases including 7 types of cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cirrhosis of the liver and several infectious diseases. In addition to its risk to noncommunicable diseases, alcohol use has been identified as an important risk factor for different types of injury including road traffic injuries, drowning, fall and violence. Globally, an estimated 900 000 injury deaths in 2016 were attributable to alcohol, including around 41% of deaths due to road injuries, 17% due to self-harm and around 10% due to interpersonal violence. In the same year the rate of alcohol-attributable deaths in the Region was 24.3 per 100 000 people. To solve future problems associated with alcohol, we must take action now to discourage alcohol consumption in the first place. It is important to tackle the underlying causes of alcohol consumption, and in turn prevent alcohol-related health loss, including from injury and violence. This includes identifying and addressing the social and commercial determinants that contribute to alcohol-related harm and identifying synergies between alcohol control and other interventions, such as policies that regulate drink and drive. WHO in the Western Pacific supports countries in the dissemination and implementation of WHO’s technical guidance through the SAFER initiative , which outlines 5 evidence-based recommendations to preventing and reducing alcohol-related harms. WHO supports monitoring and evaluation of intervention progress. The following targets and frameworks guide the Region's work to help countries prevent and respond to alcohol-related harm: Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being. Sustainable Development Goal target 3.5: Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. The Global Action Plan on the Prevention and Control of NCD 2013-2020, includes a global target of at least 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol, as appropriate, within the national context by 2025.

        "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites) change when they are exposed to antimicrobial drugs (such as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, antimalarials, and anthelmintics). Microorganisms that develop AMR are sometimes referred to as “superbugs”. As a result, the medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread to others. AMR occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes. However, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials is accelerating this process. Antimicrobial resistance is a complex problem that affects all of society and is driven by many interconnected factors. Single, isolated interventions have limited impact. Coordinated action is required to minimize the emergence and spread of AMR.

        "content": "Breastfeeding is the best way of providing young infants with the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. Virtually, all mothers can breastfeed, provided they have accurate information and the support of their family, the health care system and society at large. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years and beyond. WHO also recommends early and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in and kangaroo mother care, which significantly improve neonatal survival and reduce morbidity. In the Western Pacific, 15 Member States have adopted national legal measures aligned with the International Code of Marketing for Breastmilk Substitutes to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. WHO and UNICEF recommend that children initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life – meaning no other foods or liquids are provided, including water. Infants should be breastfed on demand – that is as often as the child wants, day and night. No bottles, teats or pacifiers should be used. From the age of 6 months, children should begin eating safe and adequate complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to two years of age or beyond. WHO actively promotes breastfeeding as the best source of nourishment for infants and young children, and is working to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months up to at least 50% by 2025. WHO provides guidance to Member States on eliminating exposure of the general public to marketing of breast-milk substitutes and the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children through implementing the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in the Western Pacific Region. In addition, WHO works with partners such as the International Labor Organization on maternity protection so that mothers can be with their infants to breastfeed, and with UNICEF on a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative to help new mothers initiate breastfeeding after delivery. Additionally, WHO provides training courses for health workers to provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers, help them overcome problems, and monitor the growth of children. Health workers are also trained to initiate Early Essential Newborn Care, a set of simple, cost-effective interventions that benefit all mothers and newborns. At its core is First Embrace, a life-saving practice that promotes skin-to-skin contact between mother and child immediately after birth and helps initiate exclusive breastfeeding.

        "content": "Buruli ulcer is a chronic, debilitating skin and soft tissue infection that can lead to permanent disfigurement and disability. It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an organism that belongs to the family of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and leprosy. Infection leads to the destruction of skin and soft tissue with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms. Patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability. Early diagnosis and treatment are the only ways to minimize morbidity and prevent disability. Only three countries in the Western Pacific Region are currently endemic for Buruli ulcer - Australia, Japan and Papua New Guinea. Three countries, including China, Kiribati, and Malaysia, were previously endemic for buruli ulcer, and where the current status is not fully known. Other than Japan and Australia, most of the countries in the Region is the lack of capacity to confirm the diagnosis of Bulcer. Symptoms of Buruli ulcer begin with painless nodules and swelling, usually on the arms and legs and sometimes on other parts of the body. These areas can then develop into large ulcers with a white and yellow base. M. ulcerans produces the toxin mycolactone. This has local immunosuppressive properties that enable the disease to progress rapidly with no pain and fever, making early detection difficult. However, if the ulcers are treated quickly, most will heal completely. If diagnosed late or left untreated, the condition can lead to scarring, permanent disfigurement, and disability. Treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics and complementary treatments (under morbidity management and disability prevention/rehabilitation). Current WHO recommendations are rifampicin 10 mg/kg per body weight daily and clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg per body weight twice daily. Treatment guidance for health workers can be found in the WHO publication Treatment of mycobacterium ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer) . In addition to the antibiotics and depending on the stage of the disease, other interventions such as wound care, lymphoedema management, surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting to speed up healing) and physiotherapy are needed. Psychological support may also be needed for those with severe disease. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis, so it is important to integrate a long-term care approach into the health system to benefit all patients. The integrated approach to the control of skin-related NTDs provides an opportunity to integrate Buruli ulcer detection and its management with these diseases.

        "title": "Cancer WPRO",
        "content": "Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, particularly in developing countries. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, it is estimated that close to 6.8 million new cases of cancer occurred in 2022 (3.6 million in men and 3.2 million in women). Cancer kills nearly 3.5 million people each year in the Western Pacific Region. Cancer prevention is highly cost effective and its economic and societal benefits are immense. Between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. There are primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and early detection measures for reducing cancer. Primary prevention refers to avoidance or reduction in cancer risk factors, the integration of activities to modify risk factors, and use protective of therapeutics: avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and decreasing red meat and fatty foods consumption exercise regularly limit alcohol use practice safe sex get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation Secondary prevention are those interventions that leads to early discovery and control of cancer. This includes screening for early detection and treatment of precancerous and cancerous lesions through HPV DNA tests, Pap smears, prostate specific antigen tests, and mammography. Tertiary prevention is started after a positive diagnosis of cancer and is aimed at improving quality of life and survivorship. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 9.7 million deaths in 2022. About 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease. The Western Pacific Region accounts for 36% of the global burden. In response to the increasing cancer cases in the Region, WHO has supported Member States to screen for cervical cancer especially in vulnerable and hard to reach populations. WHO has developed and conducted workshops and trainings for Member States and health workers on cancer registry and hepatitis and liver cancer and has implemented research modules. As part of the Global Initiative on Cervical Cancer Elimination , the regional office is support Mongolia to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment, as well as increase HPV vaccination. Additionally, as part of the WHO Global Initiative on Childhood Cancer with St. Jude, the regional office is supporting Mongolia, Philippines and Viet Nam to provide quality services for children with cancer. In response to the global effort towards cervical cancer elimination, the regional office has developed a Strategic Framework for the Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer in the Western Pacific Region 2022 – 2030 . This framework will provide support and guidance for Member States in developing their domestic cervical cancer prevention and control action plans.

They are the number one cause of death globally. CVDs include coronary heart disease (heart attacks), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), raised blood pressure (hypertension), peripheral artery disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease and heart failure. Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels – a heart attack or stroke may be the first warning of underlying disease. The major causes of CVDs are tobacco use, physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and harmful use of alcohol. Therefore, most CVDs can be prevented by addressing these behavioural risk factors.

        "content": "No woman should die from cervical cancer, a preventable and curable disease. Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Although most infections with HPV resolve spontaneously and cause no symptoms, persistent infection can cause cervical cancer in women. In the Western Pacific Region, an estimated 145 700 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2020, and 74 900 died from the largely preventable disease. HPV vaccination and screening and treatment of precancerous lesions are cost-effective ways to prevent cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine is most effective when it is given to girls below age 15, and all women should be screened for cervical at age 35 and again at age 45. Few diseases reflect global health inequities as much as cervical cancer. The majority of cervical cancer deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. This is also where the burden of cervical cancer is greatest. Access to public health services is limited, and screening and treatment for the disease have not been widely implemented. In 2020, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer as a Public Health Problem, which recommends a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control. To be on the path to cervical cancer elimination, countries must achieve the following targets by 2030: 90% of girls fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by age 15 70% of women screened by the age of 35 and again by age 45 90% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are treated. WHO developed a new Regional Strategic Framework for the Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer in the Western Pacific after thorough consultation with Member States, experts and stakeholders. The framework guides Member States to develop policies, implement programmes and shape advocacy for the elimination of cervical cancer in the Region. The needed actions include: Step up vaccination – Work to make vaccines more affordable and accessible, and integrate HPV vaccines into national vaccination programmes. Increase screening coverage – Strengthen the capacity of human resources for health and include cervical cancer screening and treatment of precancerous lesions into local, regional and national and cancer control plans. Timely and quality treatment – Set management guidelines for all stages of cervical cancer, ensure access to treatment and provide referral pathways for higher-level care, including setting up subregional hubs.

        "content": "Over the last 50 years, human activities have released sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to affect the global climate. The resulting changes in the global climate bring a range of risks to health, from deaths in extreme high temperatures to changing patterns of infectious diseases. Climate and weather variables pose threats to food and water security, and cause outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, the increased pressure on scarce resources triggers climate-related migration and conflicts. Under business-as-usual scenarios, it is estimated that between 2030 to 2050, climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths annually. Health systems must be made more resilient, especially in developing countries, in order to respond to the impacts of climate change. There is a need for an interdisciplinary and holistic approach among governments, communities and individuals coupled with changes in behaviour and practices in order to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure sustainability. Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations and those with underlying health conditions. In the short to medium term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points. WHO supports countries in building climate-resilient health systems and tracking national progress in protecting health from climate change, as well as in assessing the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from more ambitious climate action. WHO’s work plan on climate change and health includes: advocacy and partnerships: coordinating with partner agencies within the UN system, and ensuring that health is properly represented in the climate change agenda, as well as providing and disseminating information on the threats that climate change presents to human health and opportunities to promote health while cutting carbon emissions; monitoring science and evidence: coordinating reviews of the scientific evidence on the links between climate change and health; assessing country's preparedness and needs when facing climate change; and developing a global research agenda; supporting countries to protect human health from climate change: strengthening national capacities and improving the resilience and adaptive capacity of health systems to deal with the adverse health effects of climate change; and building capacity on climate change and human health: assisting countries to build capacity to reduce health vulnerability to climate change and promoting health while reducing carbon emissions.

        "content": "Disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear in adults. When unaddressed, a person with hearing loss can experience significant impacts on communication, speech, cognition, and social interactions, as well as educational and employment aspects. The majority of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. The Western Pacific Region is estimated to have the highest prevalence of hearing loss in the world with approximately 7% of people experiencing hearing loss. By 2050, the Region is projected to host the largest number of people with hearing loss, approximately 760 million. WHO warns that a significant portion of these numbers in the Region consists of young people at risk of preventable hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices. This includes exposure to loud sounds on personal audio devices and in noisy entertainment venues. The WHO programme for prevention of deafness and hearing loss works towards the vision of a world in which no one experiences hearing loss from preventable causes and those with unavoidable hearing loss can achieve their full potential through appropriate interventions, education and empowerment. It aims to promote ear and hearing care (EHC), integrated within national primary health care systems. Deafness and hearing loss are widespread and found in each country in the Western Pacific. Currently, more than 546 million people live with hearing loss in the Western Pacific; 430 million of them have disabling hearing loss. In children, 60% of hearing loss cases are attributed to preventable causes. Otitis media is one of the most significant preventable conditions during early childhood in the Western Pacific Region. At the other end of the lifespan, approximately 30% of people aged 60 and older have hearing loss, mainly due to presbycusis. Without intervention, these conditions in older adults might present severe consequences for health and well-being. Many of the impacts of hearing loss can be mitigated through early detection and interventions. These include specialized education programmes and sign language instruction for young children and their families. Assistive technologies, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, closed captioning and other devices can help people with hearing loss at any age. People may also benefit from speech therapy, aural rehabilitation and other related services. WHO continues to support Member States in their efforts to address hearing loss in the Region. This includes technical support for promoting integrated people-centred ear and hearing care (IPC-EHC). WHO’s work is guided by the recommendations in the World Report on Hearing and the World Health Assembly resolution on prevention of deafness and hearing loss. In addition, the WHO supports Member States by endorsing the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific . This Framework encourage governments to adopt evidence-based, economical strategies and reshape their healthcare systems, transitioning from a \"sick system\" to a \"health system\" that fosters health-supportive environments and prioritizes individuals' needs across their lifespans. WHO’s work in the Western Pacific Region includes: Facilitating data generation and dissemination of ear and hearing care-related data and information, such as through the World Report on Hearing; Providing technical resources and guidance to facilitate planning and health systems capacity building for ear and hearing care; Providing guidance to strengthen rehabilitation for people with hearing loss through the Package of interventions for rehabilitation for hearing loss; Supporting health workforce training in ear and hearing care through the Primary ear and hearing care training resources; Observing and promoting World Hearing Day as an annual advocacy event; Building partnerships to develop strong hearing care programmes in the Region; Deafness and hearing loss Make listening safe Ear care Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) FAQ on hearWHO App hearWHO App Improving access to assistive technology (WHA 71.8) Prevention of deafness and hearing loss (WHA70.13) Prevention of hearing impairment (WHA 48.9) Featured publications World report on hearing Regional action framework for noncommunicable disease prevention and control in the Western Pacific The Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control provides a unified vision of objectives and recommended actions to combat...

        "content": "Dementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. It is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people worldwide, affecting individuals, caregivers, families, communities and societies. Dementia is not a normal part of ageing. People with dementia often live for many years after their symptoms begin, requiring long-term care and support. Dementia can be overwhelming not only for those who have it, but also for their caregivers and families. When resources are limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries, delegating dementia-related tasks and responsibilities to community workers can improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers. With the growth of ageing populations around the world, the number of people living with dementia is rising rapidly. Dementia is a syndrome characterized by deterioration in cognitive function, with Alzheimer’s disease as the most common form of dementia. While age is the most common risk factor for dementia, other diseases or injuries that affect the brain also increase the risk for developing dementia. Currently, it is the seventh leading cause of death among all diseases and is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people globally. Family members are often burdened with the cost of care due to the lack of trained professionals and access to programmes and services. Prevention and early intervention is key to improving health outcomes. The signs and symptoms of dementia are divided into 3 stages, although the exact presentation of dementia may vary across individuals depending on the underlying cause and specific circumstances. Early stage of dementia is often subtle, and include symptoms such as forgetfulness, losing track of time, and becoming lost in places that are familiar. Middle stage is when the signs and symptoms of dementia are clearer and may include, forgetting recent events or people’s names, becoming confused while at home, difficulty communicating, needing assistance in personal care, and behavioural changes such as wandering and repeated questioning. At the late or final stages of dementia, individuals living with this condition are nearly or entirely dependent on others. They may exhibit unawareness of time and place, having difficulty recognizing friends and family, increased need for assisted care, difficulty walking or moving, and behaviour changes that may include aggression. WHO recognizes dementia as a public health priority. The Global action plan on the public health response to dementia provides a comprehensive blueprint for action across 7 areas: making dementia a public health priority, increasing dementia awareness, inclusion and friendliness; reducing the risk of dementia; improving diagnosis, treatment and care; supporting dementia carers; enhancing health information systems for dementia, and fostering research and innovation.

        "title": "Dengue and severe dengue WPRO",
        "content": "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily through Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus. It is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. More than 3.9 billion people in over 129 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with an estimated 96 million symptomatic cases and an estimated 40 000 deaths every year. Cases of dengue has increased over six folds since 2000. In the Western Pacific Region, at least 15 countries report dengue infections with many more cases reported every 2-3 years due to seasonality. During peak years, countries in the Region report an estimated 450 000 suspected cases. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2-7 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, sometimes causing complications or death. The most common symptom of dengue is fever which usually occurs after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito. High fever (40°C/ 104°F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms: Headaches Pain behind the eyes Nausea, vomiting Swollen glands Joint, bone or muscle pains Rash The disease may develop into severe dengue with the onset of warning signs occurring around 3 to 7 days after the first sign of illness despite a decrease in fever. Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in countries across the Western Pacific Region. Special attention needs to be given to these signs and symptoms as they indicate the need for immediate medical care. Severe abdominal pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding gums Vomiting blood Rapid breathing Fatigue/ restlessness Small red spots on the lips, fingers, etc. Most people who get sick with dengue will recover in about a week. They should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. There is no vaccine or specific medication to treat dengue. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and pain. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding. Since dengue mosquito bites primarily during the day with peak activity at dawn and dusk, effective prevention measures include: Using mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers Putting window and door screens and mosquito nets Eliminating mosquito breeding sites by covering water storage containers, draining standing water and discarding used bottles, tins, tyres and others that collect rainwater. Mosquito control measures should also be implemented in places of work, schools, etc. Community participation plays an important role in dengue prevention. As every household aims to reduce mosquito breeding sites, the transmission rate will decrease or maybe even stop.

        "title": "Diabetes WPRO",
        "content": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough of the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. Diabetes is one of the four major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and its global prevalence has been steadily increasing in recent years. In 2018, an estimated 131 million people in the Western Pacific were living with diabetes. In 2019, an estimated 262 000 people in the Region died due to diabetes. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes, but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms. The longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent and delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, be physically active, eat a healthy diet that limits sugars and saturated fats, and avoid tobacco use. People with type 1 diabetes require blood glucose control and daily insulin injections. People with type 2 diabetes can be treated with oral medication, but may also require insulin. Blood pressure control, foot care, and treatment for other complications, including screening and treatment for retinopathy, are also important.

It is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. Diarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. The danger of diarrhoea comes from dehydration. It is a major cause of death and serious illness in children under five years old. A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene. Most diarrhoea can be treated with oral-rehydration and zinc. Breastfeeding dramatically reduces the risk of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality.

        "title": "Digital health WPRO",
        "content": "Digital health is increasingly playing a pivotal role in transforming health by leveraging technology to improve health and well-being. It has the potential to drive transformative primary care, radically change health services delivery, support the reform of health systems, and reshape the future of people centric health. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the adoption and acceptance of digital health services and systems, changing health-seeking and providing behaviours. This was most acutely seen in the areas of remote care and disease management, such as with telemedicine, digital surveillance, and other solutions to address the needs of patients. However, this rapid expansion of digital health has also brought new challenges, especially in the areas of governance and regulation, and ethical use of technology and partnerships. While the development of digital health is happening at an unprecedented scale, there is wide disparity in its adoption in the Region and its true potential is largely untapped in most settings in the Western Pacific Region. There is immense potential for Member States to leverage digital health effectively by addressing the emerging governance challenges, building people-centric health technologies, and navigating the rapidly evolving and changing digital health landscape. The interrelated social and technical health landscape in the Western Pacific Region varies by geography, heterogeneity of cultures and resources, and socioeconomic conditions. This variation characterizes the challenges faced, the potential solutions and consequently the priorities of Member States for developing digital health. Across the variation in digital growth and priorities, there are several commonalities in development in the digital landscape across the Region. There has been a rapid expansion in connectivity and smart phone usage. The familiarity of providers, patients and the people in general with digital health tools is driving an increased demand for them, beyond just the demand by health systems. Simultaneously, governments are also evolving in their approach towards digital health. Governments have proven increasingly willing to regulate and establish norms and standards on the use of digital solutions, which has increased investment in digital solutions. Non-traditional actors, such as tech giants, play an ever-expanding role in digital health, disrupting traditional service delivery channels. This dynamic has led to an increase in public-private partnerships and growing private sector participation in public health. Based on a WHO assessment of digital health capabilities in the Region, the areas of equity, digital literacy and stakeholder engagement have much room for growth, with data often not available. While there was significantly much more progress in the areas of governance, infrastructure, digital health solutions and financing, there is still limited or partial adoption across the Region. These findings highlight that there is much work needed to address the variety of challenges and opportunities in digital health in the Region. Concerted support would be needed to ensure that digital health serves to narrow the digital divide with systems that improve the health and well-being of more people. WHO is committed to supporting Member States in leveraging the potential of digital health through ecosystems designed to provide people-centric health. Strategically designed digital health systems are central to achieving the shared vision of WHO work with Member States and partners in the Western Pacific Region. Priority actions for WHO in working with Member States include the following: Support Member States to develop digital health strategies that are aligned to the country's health plan. Support knowledge exchange and transfer of lessons learned in key areas such as digital health, governance, data management, workforce training and solutions development. Provide tailored technical support to Member States to act on the five strategic domains of the Regional Framework. Work as one WHO across all three levels of the Organization to provide harmonized, timely and feasible technical assistance to Member States; Generate a strong evidence base, in collaboration with academia and other partners, to inform digital health policies and deliver impact. Build a reserve of technical assistance through networks of experts, technical partners and collaborating centers.

        "title": "Diphtheria WPRO",
        "content": "Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium which is spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. This bacterium produces a toxin that can harm or destroy human body tissues and organs. One type of diphtheria affects the throat and sometimes the tonsils. The infection can also affect the skin and, more rarely, mucous membranes at other sites such as the (ear, genitalia and conjunctiva). Diphtheria affects people of all ages, but most often it strikes unimmunized children. In temperate climates, diphtheria tends to occur during the colder months. The disease can be fatal. Between 5% and 10% of diphtheria patients die, even if properly treated. Untreated, the disease claims even more lives. The bacteria most commonly infect the respiratory system. Respiratory diphtheria usually occurs after an incubation period of 2–5 days (range 1–10 days). Depending on the anatomical location, respiratory disease may be nasal, pharyngeal, or laryngeal, or any combination of these. Pharyngeal diphtheria is the most common form. The onset is usually relatively slow and characterized by mild fever and exudative pharyngitis initially with progression of symptoms over 2 to 3 days. In classic cases, the exudate organizes into a pseudo-membrane that gradually forms in the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx. The pseudo-membrane is typically asymmetrical, greyish white in appearance and is firmly attached to the underlying tissue. Attempts to remove the pseudo-membrane result in bleeding at the site. The pseudo-membrane may extend into the nasal cavity and the larynx causing obstruction of the airways, which is a medical emergency that often requires tracheotomy. Anterior cervical lymph nodes become markedly enlarged and, in some patients, there is considerable inflammation and edema of surrounding tissues (“bull-neck” appearance) with greater morbidity and mortality. Absorption of diphtheria toxin into the bloodstream results in toxic damage to organs such as the heart, kidneys and peripheral nerves. The bacteria can also infect the skin, causing open sores or ulcers. The best protection against diphtheria infection is vaccination. WHO recommends a three-dose primary series and three booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. The recommended schedule of the three-dose primary series is with the first dose administered as early as 6 weeks of age; subsequent doses should be given with an interval of at least four weeks between doses, and the third dose of the primary series should be completed by 6 months of age, if possible. The three boosters should be given in combination with tetanus toxoid at 12–23 months of age, 4–7 years of age and 9–15 years of age, using age-appropriate vaccine formulations. For susceptible exposed individuals, vaccination with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine is strongly recommended.

        "title": "Disability WPRO",
        "content": "Disability is experienced when a person’s health condition and barriers in their environment prevent them from performing activities, like self-care, and restrict their participation in areas like education, work and community life. Health conditions, such as cerebral palsy, stroke, amputation and depression, may reduce a person’s mobility, vision, hearing, cognition or any combination of these. Physical barriers, stigma, and lack of access to assistive products and social support can make it harder for people with health conditions to access health services and lead healthy lives. Disability is a major public health issue in the Western Pacific Region, with more than 15% of the population experiencing long-term, significant disability. The prevalence of disability has increased significantly over the past 10 years as more people age with chronic health conditions. Communicable diseases and injuries, such as from road traffic accidents, also contribute to the prevalence of disability. Disability is a cross-cutting area in health, and it needs to be incorporated into the design and delivery of all health services at all levels of care. When health services are not inclusive of persons with disabilities, they can experience barriers that result in them having worse health outcomes than others. Persons with disabilities have worse health outcomes and die earlier than the rest of the general population in the Western Pacific Region. This situation arises because persons with disabilities disproportionately encounter poverty, discrimination, stigma and exclusion, and physical barriers. These can limit their ability to participate in education and employment and access health care. Health is a human right, and it is a state obligation to ensure that persons with disabilities can attain the highest standard of health. This can only be achieved when different sectors work together to create an inclusive and enabling environment for all and when health systems are responsive to the diverse needs of persons with disabilities. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States to achieve the best possible health outcomes for persons with disabilities in the Region. This is prioritized by: Making health services more inclusive of persons with disabilities. Including persons with disabilities in emergency preparedness and response. Cross-sectoral efforts to create environments that promote the health of persons with disabilities. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States by providing technical support, facilitating capacity-building, training health workers on disability inclusion, and generating data and guidance. WHO continues to strengthen its collaboration with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) in the Region, respecting the right of persons with disabilities to actively participate in efforts to enhance health outcomes and advance global health goals.

        "title": "Drowning in the Western Pacific",
        "content": "Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid, which can result in death, non-fatal injury (morbidity), or no lasting harm (no morbidity). In 2021, an estimated 300,000 drowning deaths occurred globally, with children and young people disproportionately affected. Drowning is the fourth leading cause of death among children aged 1–4 years and the third leading cause of death among children aged 5–14 years. Approximately 92% of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where the drowning rate is 3.2 times higher than in high-income countries. The Western Pacific and South-East Asia Regions account for the highest number of drowning deaths globally. In the Western Pacific Region, more than 84 000 people drowned in 2021—nearly 30% of the world’s drowning deaths. Drowning is the leading cause of death among children aged 5–14 years in the region. The regional drowning death rate stands at 4.3 per 100 000 population, higher than the global average of 3.8 per 100 000. While drowning primarily affects children, the highest rate of drowning deaths in the region occurs among those aged 70 years or older standing at 13.7 deaths per 100 000 population. Men consistently bear a greater burden of drowning than women. In addition to fatal drowning, many individuals experience non-fatal drowning, resulting in long-term health consequences and a substantial number of hospitalizations annually. Despite its magnitude and preventability, drowning often receives low prioritization in public health agendas—particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Risk Factors Drowning is a multifaceted public health issue, shaped by a range of individual, social, and environmental risk factors. Key risk factors include age, sex, poverty and inequality, occupational exposure, climate-related risks, transport on water, and migration and refuge-seeking. Age . Young children are at particularly high risk of drowning due to their underdeveloped ability to assess danger, as well as a lack of swimming and water safety skills. Risk increases significantly when children are in or near water without active adult supervision. Among older children and adolescents, factors such as growing independence, peer pressure, increased risk-taking behaviours, entry into the workforce, and experimentation with alcohol and drugs further elevate drowning risk. Older adults also face distinct risks, including reduced physical ability, mobility limitations, pre-existing medical conditions, and an associated increased use of medications. Sex. Globally, the drowning death rate for males is more than twice that of females. Males are generally more likely to engage in high-risk behaviours—such as swimming alone, swimming at night, or in open water—and are less likely to wear lifejackets. Alcohol use is also higher among males during aquatic activities. In addition, men are more frequently employed in work that frequently exposes them to potentially hazardous water, such as fishing, construction, transport and maritime occupations. Poverty and inequality . Drowning disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations. The drowning rate in low-income countries is 3.2 times higher than in high-income countries. Regardless of a country’s economic development, drowning often affects the poorest and people with low educational attainment who live in rural settings, especially where people have close daily contact with water for work, transport and agriculture. Occupational exposure. Fishers are among the most vulnerable occupational groups due to prolonged exposure to water under hazardous conditions. Long working hours, severe weather, and physically demanding tasks heighten the risk of drowning. Climate change has further aggravated these risks, increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and inland fisheries prone to flooding. Small-scale fishers are particularly vulnerable, as many lack access to lifejackets, emergency communication tools, and safety equipment on board. Climate-related risks . Climate change is significantly increasing the risk of drowning by intensifying extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Globally, floods accounted for 44% of all disasters between 2000 and 2019, with an estimated 75% of flood-related fatalities resulting from drowning. Rising global temperatures also contribute to more frequent heatwaves, prompting people to spend more time in and around water. This greater exposure, combined with increased alcohol consumption on hot days, further elevates drowning risk. Transport on water . Travelling on water, particularly in volatile weather conditions or without appropriate safety equipment, can increase drowning risk. In many low- and middle-income countries, water transport is significantly less regulated than in high-income countries. As a result, daily commuting often takes place on overcrowded and unsafe vessels, operated by staff who have not been appropriately trained to recognize dangerous conditions or perform high-seas navigation, increasing risk of boat capsize and collision. Migration and refuge-seeking. An increasing number of people are being displaced from their homes due to conflict, violence, political or economic instability, climate change, and other disasters. Many are forced to migrate through irregular and dangerous routes, which often involve crossing large bodies of water under treacherous conditions. These journeys are frequently undertaken in overcrowded and unsafe vessels, significantly increasing the risk of drowning. The 2014 WHO Global Report on Drowning outlines 10 evidence-based, cost-effective, and scalable actions for drowning prevention, adaptable to local contexts: A wide range of proven actions can reduce drowning risk across diverse settings. Installing barriers (e.g. covering wells, using doorway barriers and playpens, fencing swimming pools etc.) to control access to water hazards, or removing water hazards entirely greatly reduces water hazard exposure and risk, especially for young children. Community-based, supervised child care for pre-school children can also reduce drowning risk and has other proven health and development benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But this must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety. Training bystanders in safe rescue and resuscitation is also a vital component of drowning prevention. Survival in drowning incidents often depends on the immediate actions of those nearby. Equipping community members—particularly in high-risk areas—with practical, context-specific training improves the likelihood of effective and timely rescue. It also reduces the risk of harm to would-be rescuers, who may otherwise attempt unsafe interventions. Effective policies and legislation are also important for drowning prevention. This includes setting and enforcing safety regulations for boating, shipping and ferry operations. In parallel, building resilience to flooding and other extreme weather events through strengthened disaster preparedness, land use planning, and early warning systems can prevent drowning during flood disasters. Developing a national water safety strategy can raise awareness of safety around water, build consensus around solutions, provide strategic direction and a framework to guide multisectoral action and allow for monitoring and evaluation of efforts. Public awareness and advocacy are essential to mobilizing action. Effectively communicating the human impact of drowning—while highlighting practical, life-saving solutions—can influence policy, empower communities, and drive investment in prevention. Mass media campaigns are particularly powerful in shaping behaviours and increasing public acceptance of safety measures, especially those that protect children. Finally, accurate and timely data on who is drowning, where, when, and why is essential. Robust data systems enable countries to design targeted, evidence-based interventions that respond to local priorities and reach the most vulnerable populations. Since the launch of WHO's Global report on drowning preventing a leading killer in 2014 and the follow-up resource Preventing drowning: an implementation guide in 2017, WHO has been working to scale up advocacy and action for the prevention of drowning. The Regional Status Report on Drowning in the Western Pacific provides countries with WHO-recommended best practices on drowning prevention interventions and policies, including day care for children, the use of barriers for controlling access to water, public awareness campaigns focused on behaviour change, and policies and legislation on water safety, including regulation of recreational boating and maritime transport. At a regional level, WHO organizes training programmes and convenes workshops to draw together representatives of governments, NGOs and UN agencies working on drowning prevention.

        "content": "Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms that occurs in two main forms in humans: cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis. Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs. Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs. Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death. Both types of echinococcosis are expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. Most of the global burden of Echinococcosis is prevalent in China’s northern areas and Mongolia Cystic echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the parasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and size of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. In cystic echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys, spleen, muscles, central nervous system, and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Alveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs, and brain following the dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise, and signs of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is progressive and fatal. Both cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. The treatment used should be decided based on results from ultrasound images of the cyst. Treatments can include percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique, surgery, anti-infective drug treatments or simply watching and waiting. Human cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests. Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology. Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses.

Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population. Criteria for selection of essential medicines Essential medicines are selected with due regard to disease prevalence and public health relevance, evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, and, within the same therapeutic group, comparative costs and cost-effectiveness. Essential medicines are intended to be available within the context of functioning health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality, and at a price the individual and the community can afford. The Model List is a guide for the development of national and institutional essential medicine lists. It was not designed as a global standard. However, for the past 40 years the Model List has led to a global acceptance of the concept of essential medicines as a powerful means to promote health equity. Most countries have national lists and some have provincial or state lists as well. National lists of essential medicines usually relate closely to national guidelines for clinical health care practice which are used for the training and supervision of health workers. The concept of essential medicines is forward-looking. It incorporates the need to regularly update medicines selections to reflect new therapeutic options and changing therapeutic needs; the need to ensure medicine quality; and the need for continued development of better medicines, medicines for emerging diseases, and medicines to meet changing resistance patterns. Once thought of as relevant only in resource-constrained settings, the WHO Model Lists are now seen as equally relevant to high-, middle- and low-income countries, particularly with the inclusion of new, highly effective and expensive medicines in more recent years.

        "content": "In the Western Pacific Region, over 90 million people experience visual impairment, including 10 million that are blind. Blindness can be avoided in 8 out of 10 cases with appropriate treatment or early prevention. Eye health can be promoted through the integration of comprehensive eye-care services into existing health systems. General approaches are evidence-based advocacy, development and implementation of eye health policies and programmes, and multi-stakeholder partnerships to strengthen eye health towards achieving the global target of a 25% reduction in the prevalence of avoidable visual impairment by 2019 (from the 2010 baseline). The WHO Blindness Prevention and Control programme supports Member States to reduce avoidable vision impairment as a public health problem and to secure access to low-vision and rehabilitation services for those in need. In the Western Pacific, the most frequent conditions that can be targeted effectively with preventive strategies include congenital and acquired eye conditions, such as retinopathy of prematurity in newborns, diabetic retinopathy in adults, ocular infections and inflammations. Additionally, cataracts, refractive errors, and posterior segment disease are the most common causes of blindness and low vision in the Region. Interventions to prevent vitamin A deficiency, measles, trachoma, and rubella are highly effective in reducing the risk of eye conditions. A good example of prevention in countries of the Western Pacific has been the elimination of the bacterial infection trachoma, which can provoke blindness. Cambodia, China, and Lao PDR have been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma. Furthermore, in 2017, Vanuatu was the first Pacific island to eliminate trachoma. Although effective interventions and coverage exist to the Region to address two the leading causes of vision impairment - refractive errors and cataracts – countries are working to increase eye care. By 2030, all countries in the Region are working to increase effective coverage of refractive errors by 40% and an increase effective coverage of cataract surgery by 30%. Highly cost-effective interventions for these conditions, including spectacles and cataract surgery can substantially improve a person’s quality of life. Vision impairment that cannot be corrected or reversed requires rehabilitation measures, including low vision aids and assistive technologies. For those living with blindness, braille reading, counselling, home skills training, mobility training with white canes, and digital assistive technologies can ensure free, independent, and safe mobility. To achieve better visual health in the Region, WHO is working closely with Member States and stakeholders, such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, The Fred Hollows Foundation, and the Singapore National Eye Care, to plan and deliver Integrated people-centered eye care (IPEC). Treatment and care for many eye conditions can be improved by implementing IPEC, and promoting comprehensive treatment and intervention across the life course. Additionally, countries are also working to improve data on better treatment processes in order to improve overall care.

        "content": "Access to safe and healthy food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health. However, unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances can cause more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. Examples of unsafe food include uncooked foods of animal origin, fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticides and faeces, and raw shellfish containing marine biotoxins. More than 50 000 people die every year in the Western Pacific Region from consuming unsafe food and another 125 million fall ill from unsafe food. Each year, 30% of cases of foodborne illness are in children under age 5 and an estimated 7000 children die as a result. Diarrhoeal disease agents are the main cause of foodborne illness; the most common disease-causing agents are norovirus, non-typhoidal salmonella and campylobacter, accounting for nearly 45% of all foodborne illnesses. However, Aflatoxins are responsible for many foodborne deaths in the Region. Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic development by straining health care systems and harming national economies, tourism and trade. The burden of foodborne diseases to public health and to economies has often been underestimated due to underreporting and difficulty to establish causal relationships between food contamination and resulting illness or death. Children aged 5 and under carry 40% of the foodborne disease burden, with 125 000 deaths every year. The consumption and production of safe food have immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet and the economy. Safe food is essential to human health and well-being, only food that is safe can be traded. Safe food allows for the uptake of nutrients and promotes long-term human development. The 2019 World Bank report on the economic burden of foodborne diseases indicated that US$ 110 billion is lost each year in productivity and medical expenses resulting from unsafe food in low- and middle-income countries. Unsafe or contaminated food leads to trade rejections, economic losses and food loss and waste, while safe food production improves economic opportunities by enabling market access and productivity. WHO provides regional leadership to facilitate investment and coordinated evidence-based action across multiple sectors. WHO supports Member States to build strong, sustainable and resilient national food control systems with a balance of responsibilities between different stakeholders, including consumers. WHO also calls for the transformation of food systems to make food safe, healthy and sustainably produced for all the world population. The Asia Pacific Health Security Action Framework (APHSAF) supports the objectives of global and regional strategies for food safety, including the WHO Global Strategy for Food Safety 2022-2030 and the Regional Framework for Action on Food Safety in the Western Pacific through strengthening capacities to detect, assess and manage foodborne disease outbreaks and One Health collaborations with animal, environment and food-production sectors. The Regional Framework for Action on Food Safety in the Western Pacific approved in 2017 has a timeframe for implementation of 2018-2025. It is intended to guide Member States on strategic actions and a stepwise approach to strengthen food safety systems to better manage food safety risks and respond to food safety incidents and emergencies, contributing to the Region’s health security. WHO enables resilient food safety systems through: providing scientific advice and research to help develop international standards for food safety through the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO Codex Alimentarius, monitoring the global burden of foodborne diseases and supporting countries in burden estimates, ensuring stronger national food control systems by comprehensive assessments through the FAO/WHO food control system assessment tool, and implementing adequate infrastructure to respond to food safety emergencies through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN).

        "title": "Foodborne trematodiases WPRO",
        "content": "Foodborne trematode (FBT) infections, taeniasis and cysticercosis are noteworthy neglected tropical diseases caused by trematodes (flatworms or “flukes”) or pork tapeworms. People become infected through the consumption of raw or poorly cooked freshwater fish, crustaceans and vegetables hat harbour the parasite larvae. Early and light infections often pass unnoticed, as they are asymptomatic or only scarcely symptomatic. Conversely, if the worm load is high, general malaise is common and severe pain can occur, especially in the abdominal region. Chronic infections are invariably associated with severe morbidity. Foodborne trematodiases result in severe liver and lung disease. Two species of FBTs (liver flukes) are confined to Asia. In some hyperendemic villages in Lao PDR, a record 80% prevalence of one species ( O. viverrine ) have been recorded. Eating raw fish and contaminated freshwater plants is a possible behavioural cause. WHO supports endemic countries in the WPR in conducting disease mapping, donation of Praziquantel for treatment and MDAs, and building capacity to diagnose, treat, and prevent cases of these Zoonotic diseases. Transmission of these trematodes is closely linked with food habits and hygiene in endemic areas. Therefore, food safety risk communications play a key role for the prevention of reinfection. As they are also zoonotic, veterinary public health and environmental measures, including treating domestic or livestock animals, enforcing separation between husbandry and humans, and draining grazing lands, might also be adopted. The public health burden due to foodborne trematodiases is predominantly due to morbidity rather than mortality with early and light infections often going unnoticed. Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the organ in which the adult worms are located in. Clonorchis and Opisthorchis species have adult flukes that lodge in the smaller bile ducts of the liver, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis of surrounding tissues. Acute or early infection may result in non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic infection can result in cholangiocarcinoma, a fatal bile duct cancer. Both C. sinensis and O. viverrini are classified as carcinogens. Fasciola adult worms lodge in larger bile ducts and gall bladder resulting in inflammation, fibrosis, blockage, colic pain, and jaundice. Chronic infection can result in liver cirrhosis. Treatment of foodborne trematodiases is important to prevent progression of clinical disease and reduce associated morbidity. Treatment can be offered through preventive chemotherapy or individual case management. Preventive chemotherapy involves a population-based approach where everyone in a given region or area is given medicines, irrespective of their infection status. This is recommended in areas where large numbers of people are infected. Praziquantel is recommended for the treatment of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis while triclabendazole is recommended for fascioliasis. Both praziquantel and triclabendazole can be used for the treatment of paragonimiasis. Individual case-management involves the treatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection. This approach is more appropriate where cases are less clustered and where health facilities are available.

        "content": "Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a particular society considers appropriate for men, women, boys, girls, and gender diverse people. Societal norms, roles and relations that are based on gender, can affect health by influencing the health-related experiences and behaviours of individuals and their relationships with others. Comparing data between women and men in the Western Pacific, for instance, women and girls may experience limited control over decision-making about their bodies, in their intimate relationships, families and communities, exposing them to violence, coercion and harmful practices, placing their health and wellbeing at risk. In comparison, traditional and rigid expectations of masculinity can increase men’s vulnerability to health risks and make them less inclined to seek health care in a timely manner. This, in turn, can contribute to delays in diagnosis, care and prevention, adversely impacting their health, and putting men at higher risk of dying from both infectious as well as noncommunicable diseases. Rigid gender norms can also negatively affect gender diverse people, who are more likely to experience violence and coercion, stigma and discrimination, including from health workers. Gender equality in health means that all genders experience fairness and justice in the distribution of benefits, power, resources, and responsibilities, so that individuals can realize their full rights and potential to achieve the highest attainable standard of health. Achieving gender equality in health often requires specific measures to mitigate barriers as well as to address systemic biases, promote cultural shifts, and foster inclusive policies that empower individuals of all genders. In the Western Pacific Region, the work of WHO is aligned with and supports the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages , and SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls . With this, WHO seeks to ensure that every person, regardless of gender, can live a safe and healthy life. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States to address gender-related barriers to health and ensure gender-responsive health service provision, information and delivery by: Engaging in technical collaboration to build national capacity for gender-responsive and transformative policy and programme design, implementation and monitoring, including advocating for active participation of all genders; Providing technical assistance to generate new evidence on gender in identifying and addressing gender-related issues and barriers through multisectoral and multistakeholder collaboration; Providing technical assistance to build national capacity on gender mainstreaming within both WHO and Ministries, across all technical areas of work; Promoting key partnerships to advance gender equality within and beyond the health sector to achieve common goals and maximise impact; Developing platforms for regional and cross-country knowledge exchange, learning and collaboration on best practices and lessons learned on gender-responsive health policies, strategies, systems, policies, and practices; Promoting gender equality in health workforce development, participation and leadership across governance structures.

        "title": "Health equity WPRO",
        "content": "Health equity is the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically, geographically, or otherwise. Health equity is intricately linked to both structural and social determinants of health, as these factors influence the distribution of power and resources, as well as health outcomes, experiences, and opportunities within and across populations. In the Western Pacific Region, health inequities exist within and across countries, and are widening in some cases. Disaggregated data reveals variations in life expectancy, under-5 mortality, and other key health indicators among different population groups, highlighting the unequal burden of disease. Limited access to healthcare services, often influenced by preventable barriers, including financial constraints, linguistic and cultural differences, and a lack of access to pertinent health information, further influences health inequities in the region. Social determinants, including legal, political, cultural, educational, financial, and environmental factors, contribute to divergent and unequal health trajectories. The impact of these health inequities is profound, leading to compromised overall health and well-being within certain segments of populations. Beyond the immediate health outcomes, these health inequities have broader societal implications, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for educational and economic advancement. Addressing health inequities in the Western Pacific Region is not only a matter of public health but also a crucial step toward fostering a more just and inclusive society, with potential long-term benefits for both individuals, their families and society at large. Further, building resilient, people-centered health systems that acknowledge and respond to the needs of different population groups, will not only enhance access to health-care services for all and help achieve UHC, but will also ensure that communities experiencing social inequities receive equitable access to quality care. People living in the Western Pacific Region have a range of health experiences that are shaped by the social, environmental and commercial determinants of health. Although the Western Pacific Region has made progress on many health-related Sustainable Development Goals, inequities persist across many dimensions of health and impact both health status and access to services. Intersectional health inequities predominantly burden those living in poverty, with the least education, and in and remote areas. Women and LGBTQI+ individuals who live in these conditions experience the most acute inequities. Health inequities impact health status across the Region, as is evidenced through life expectancy, infectious diseases, injury, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Men in the Region have a lower life expectancy than women. People who reported having no education also have less knowledge of HIV than those with education, and people who are younger are more likely to die by suicide, in the Region. There is also a gender gap in some countries, where women are more likely to die as a result of NCDs, such as heart disease, than men. Health inequities not only impact health status, but also access to services – particularly reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health services. For example, people who live in rural areas, and have low incomes and lower levels of education are least likely to receive skilled care during childbirth. Children in poor households with mothers without education are less likely to be immunized. These are some ways the social determinants of health shape health equity in the Western Pacific Region. Efforts to reduce health inequities necessitate disaggregated data, evidence-based policies and interventions at the primary health care and community levels that consider the unique contextual factors within the diverse populations of the region. In the Western Pacific Region, WHO is guided by principles of proportionate universalism, acknowledging the necessity to address the varying needs of people living in vulnerable situations, while working towards solutions that enhance universal health coverage, high quality education, comprehensive social and labour protections and equitable application of legal frameworks. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports Member States to address health inequities by: Building capacity at national and local level in mapping, measuring and visualizing health inequities and their determinants within and across countries. Supporting in the establishment or strengthening of regional and national monitoring systems of social determinants of health and health inequities. Building capacity at national and local level on how to design/implement strategies/programs to address inequities in health. Supporting efforts that serve to identify and meaningful engage with diverse and representative communities and sectors for health.

        "content": "The goal of health financing policy is to move towards universal health coverage (UHC) by ensuring adequate spending on health at national and local levels and effective allocation of financial resources to different types of public and personal health services. Putting in place proper health financing mechanisms can ensure that different population groups, especially the most vulnerable and high-risk groups, can access care and be protected from catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment due to health payments. Health financing has three core functions – collection, pooling and purchasing. Analysing the sources of funding channelled to the health system (collection), risk-pooling to share the burden of health costs through cross-subsidization by pool funding according to members’ health risks or geographically distinct health funding pools. Using different types of payment mechanisms (purchasing) can provide insights into the health system's efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and sustainability in moving towards UHC. C ountries can progress towards universal health coverage when people are financially protected while accessing health services. This requires ensuring that the health system can respond adequately to countries’ health challenges and that there are health financing mechanisms and arrangements that actively enable these goals. Despite improvements in health service coverage in the Western Pacific Region over the past decade, the proportion of households suffering financial hardship when accessing health services in countries has increased. In 2017, on average, 1 in 5 people in the Region incurred catastrophic health spending due to out-of-pocket payments when seeking care. This means that while there is better access to health services, more and more people are dealing with unaffordable healthcare. However, implementing sustainable health financing policies, arrangements, and mechanisms can reduce the risk of catastrophic and impoverishing health spending, reversing the negative trend to ensure a better, equitable and sustainable future for all. In the Western Pacific Region, the Regional Committee Resolutions on universal health coverage in 2015 and primary health care in 2019 emphasize strategic capacities and actions for health financing to improve financial protection. These include: financing health services using publicly funded, predictable, stable, and well-executed health budgets; utilising fiscal measures such as health taxes that create healthy behaviours; pooling funding across the health system to redistribute funds and delink them from patients’ ability to pay; coordinating and integrating health system and financing functions; having evidence-informed, performance-based, and sustainable budget allocation and hospital and healthcare provider payment mechanisms that support healthcare service delivery; implementing systematic and transparent mechanisms and institutions to develop and update the set of priority services provided to the population; and ensuring that the people understand the defined entitlements and obligations. WHO supports Member States in strengthening health financing functions and initiatives in the context of their health systems, institutions, mechanisms, and policies to enable progress towards universal health coverage. WHO works closely with governments and technical partners to support health financing policy development and implementation through evidence generation, capacity building, knowledge sharing and advocacy.

Governments play a major role in setting the governance arrangements in the health sector. They act through a broad range of legal, policy, planning and monitoring instruments. Health service providers, both public and private, and citizens, further constitute the core actors in conventional health governance models. Linkages between these three groups are essential to health system performance and the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC). International organizations, corporations and other networks also play a role in health system governance.

As a core function of public health, health promotion supports governments, communities and individuals to cope with and address health challenges. This is accomplished by building healthy public policies, creating supportive environments, and strengthening community action and personal skills. In addition to ongoing advocacy efforts, the emphasis of health promotion in the Western Pacific Region is currently on building health promotion capacity (financing and infrastructure), urban health (including healthy cities and health equity), healthy settings (including schools and workplaces) and healthy islands.

        "content": "Research is indispensable for resolving public health challenges – whether it be tackling diseases of poverty, responding to rise of chronic diseases, or ensuring that mothers have access to safe delivery practices. Likewise, shared vulnerability to global threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus and avian influenza has mobilized global research efforts in support of enhancing capacity for preparedness and response. Research is strengthening surveillance, rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and medicines. Public-private partnerships and other innovative mechanisms for research are concentrating on neglected diseases in order to stimulate the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics where market forces alone are insufficient. Research for health spans 5 generic areas of activity: measuring the magnitude and distribution of the health problem; understanding the diverse causes or the determinants of the problem, whether they are due to biological, behavioural, social or environmental factors; developing solutions or interventions that will help to prevent or mitigate the problem; implementing or delivering solutions through policies and programmes; and evaluating the impact of these solutions on the level and distribution of the problem. High-quality research is essential to fulfilling WHO’s mandate for the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. One of the Organization’s core functions is to set international norms, standards and guidelines, including setting international standards for research. Under the “WHO strategy on research for health”, the Organization works to identify research priorities, and promote and conduct research with the following 4 goals: Capacity - build capacity to strengthen health research systems within Member States. Priorities - support the setting of research priorities that meet health needs particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Standards - develop an enabling environment for research through the creation of norms and standards for good research practice.

        "content": "There cannot be a health system without health workers. The quality and availability of health workers in the right number and places determine a health system's overall effectiveness and strength. Health workers are the cornerstone of any health system and service delivery. Health workers are central to attaining, sustaining, and accelerating progress on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in health systems and widespread and continued underinvestment in the health workforce. Investment in the health workforce can yield far-reaching health, social, economic and security benefits for the 37 countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region. In the Region, the need to plan and manage a competent health workforce to adequately respond to the changing population health needs is well recognized. To address the Region’s challenges, the workforce envisioned for the future should be people-centred, culturally sensitive, adaptive, skilled in digital health, able to work and learn in teams, motivated and well-performing, and committed to professional development. The health workers also need to be protected, supported, and invested. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the Region’s health systems and widespread and long-term underinvestment in the health workforce. In general, more health workers are associated with higher UHC service coverage index attainment, affirming the centrality of the health workforce in delivering care to individuals, families and communities. Despite progress in the Region, critical gaps remain in the overall number, distribution and quality of the health workforce, as well as protections that ensure a safe work environment. In addition, ageing populations, a growing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and unforeseen health emergencies require a fit-for-purpose health workforce with evolving skills and competencies. The health needs of the population are rapidly changing. The proportion of deaths due to NCDs is projected to increase further in the future. The four main NCDs – diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases – account for nearly 87% of all deaths in the Region. Health emergencies and climate change add further risks to the population’s health. The implication is an expanding need for a greater variety and larger volume of health services. Based on the available data, there is a critical gap in the health workforce in the Region, ranging from shortages, maldistribution and inefficient use of the existing workforce. Additionally, there is also a mismatch between the health workforce occupations and roles needed to meet the health needs of the population. WHO is committed to supporting Member States in strengthening and transforming the health workforce for the future health needs of the Region. The health workforce is at the centre of health systems and services for achieving the shared vision of WHO work with Member States and partners in the Western Pacific Region. Priority actions for WHO in working with Member States include the following: generate a strong evidence base, in collaboration with academia and other partners, to inform HRH policies and deliver impact; convene regional learning platforms to accelerate the exchange of information, lessons and collaboration across areas, including HRH regulation, development, stewardship and governance; provide tailored technical support to Member States to act on the five strategic areas of the Regional Framework; work as one WHO across all three levels of the Organization to provide harmonised, timely and feasible technical assistance to Member States; build a reserve of technical assistance through networks of experts, technical partners and collaborating centres; engage with partners and alliances to strengthen the support to Member States; build a reserve of technical assistance through networks of experts, technical partners and collaborating centres; and facilitate high-level policy advocacy to sustain and scale the investment in HRH development with actors beyond health.

        "content": "Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life course helps prevent malnutrition in all its forms, as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Increased production of processed food, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium. Many people also do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and dietary fibre, such as whole grains. The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual needs (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle, degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. But basic principles of what constitute a healthy diet remain the same. A healthy diet is important sources of essential nutrients and helps protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. A healthy diet includes: fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g., lentils and beans), nuts, and whole grains, at least 400g of fruit and vegetables (i.e. 5 portions), limit foods high in fat, sugar and salt: total fat not exceeding 30% of total energy intake, saturated fat should be less than 10% and trans-fat to be less than 1% of total energy intake, reducing free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake and a further reduction to less than 5% is suggested for additional health benefits, and limiting salt to be less than 5g per day (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon). total fat not exceeding 30% of total energy intake, saturated fat should be less than 10% and trans-fat to be less than 1% of total energy intake, reducing free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake and a further reduction to less than 5% is suggested for additional health benefits, and limiting salt to be less than 5g per day (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon).

        "content": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. There are five main types of the hepatitis virus – A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people globally, and together are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related deaths. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. As of 2022, an estimated 96.8 million people in the Western Pacific are living with hepatitis B and 7.1 million with hepatitis C. While there are evidence-based, effective and safe interventions to diagnose, treat, and prevent chronic hepatitis B and C, most people remain undiagnosed and untreated. Hepatitis B and C infections lead to chronic liver disease in hundreds of millions of people. They are the most common causes of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Most people with hepatitis A, B, C, E, or D have little or no symptoms, and often do not know they have it. Each form of the virus, however, can cause more severe symptoms. Symptoms of hepatitis A, B and C may include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). In some cases, the virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of death. Hepatitis D (HDV) is only found in people already infected with hepatitis B (HBV); however, the dual infection of HBV and HDV can cause a more serious infection and poorer health outcomes, including accelerated progression to cirrhosis. Development of chronic hepatitis D is rare. Hepatitis E (HEV) begins with mild fever, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days. Some persons may also have abdominal pain, itching (without skin lesions), skin rash or joint pain. They may also exhibit jaundice, with dark urine and pale stools, and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), or occasionally acute liver failure. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus. This vaccine also prevents the hepatitis D virus infection and given at birth strongly reduces transmission risk from mother to child. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. People who are diagnosed with hepatitis B should seek for further evaluation to start treatment. There are no specific treatments for hepatitis E viruses and hospitalization is not usually required. It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the negative effect on liver function caused by these infections. Hepatitis C can cause both acute and chronic infection. Some people recover on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low. Hepatitis A virus is most common is low- and middle-income countries due to reduced access to clean and reliable water sources and the increased risk of contaminated food. A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A. Most hepatitis A infections are mild, with the majority of people recovering fully and developing immunity to further infection. Protect yourself against hepatitis by always using sterile injections, always using your own razors and blades, practising safe sex, using safe tattooing and piercing equipment, and vaccination.

        "content": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens people's defence systems. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis and other infections. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of HIV infection and is characterized by the occurrence of more than 20 life-threatening opportunistic infections or cancers. HIV is spread from the body fluid of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. HIV transmission can be prevented with appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART). People taking ART who have no evidence of the virus in their blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. They can also enjoy healthy, long, and productive lives. Key populations and their partners face higher risks of HIV infection. This includes men who have sex with men, transgender, sex workers, people who inject drugs, and people in prisons. In the Western Pacific Region, they account for the vast majority of new infections. In 2023, an estimated 2.3 million people were living with HIV in the Western Pacific Region. Of the 2.3 million, 85% knew their status, 76% were receiving HIV treatment and 73% had suppressed viral loads. An estimated 140 000 [130,000–150 000] people newly acquired HIV, and 53 000 deaths were attributed to HIV-related causes. Despite notable progress in the response to HIV in the Western Pacific region, there are some worrying shifts. Since 2019, new HIV infections have increased by 8%, and deaths related to HIV/AIDS have risen by 10%. This is contrary to the global and regional target to significantly reduce new infections and end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030 as the sustainable development goal. Notably, only 66% of children with HIV are receiving treatment, which is lower than the treatment rate for all people living with HIV. These figures highlight the urgent need to enhance efforts to prevent new HIV infections and reduce deaths in the Western Pacific Region. HIV is fully preventable. Prevention interventions include condoms and lubricant, harm reduction (including needle/syringe programmes and opioid agonist maintenance therapy), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP; taking antiretrovirals before exposure to HIV) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP; taking antiretrovirals after exposure to HIV). PrEP is a highly effective and safe HIV prevention option. WHO currently recommends three different PrEP products: oral PrEP containing tenofovir, the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) and now long acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA). Different products may be appropriate for different people depending on their circumstances and preferences. Unlike HIV treatment, PrEP is not lifelong and can be started and stopped to correspond with times someone may be exposed to HIV. PrEP should be offered alongside other HIV prevention options, including condoms and lubricant and harm reduction services. The risk of a pregnant women living with HIV transmitting the virus to her baby is between 15 and 45% without any intervention. However, identifying pregnant women living with HIV early and initiating and sustaining lifelong treatment for all women and girls of childbearing age living with HIV, can prevent transmitting the virus to their babies. Importantly, people who are successfully treated for HIV and have undetectable viral load, cannot pass the virus to their sexual partners. Within HIV prevention programmes, WHO supports the integration of hepatitis and sexually transmitted infection prevention, testing and treatment and the inclusion of services which address the sexual and reproductive health and mental health issues, that are also critical to acceptable and effective programming. HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of one or more medicines. ART does not cure HIV but reduces its replication in the blood, thereby reducing the viral load to an undetectable level. Effective ART prevents HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Someone who is on antiretroviral therapy and virally suppressed will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. WHO recommends that all people who have HIV should receive HIV treatment as early as possible. This means that people need to know they have HIV and have access to HIV diagnostic services. In many countries, HIV self-tests are available so that people can test themselves for HIV. ART should be taken every day throughout the person’s life. People can continue with safe and effective ART if they adhere to their treatment. In cases when ART becomes ineffective - HIV drug resistance - due to reasons such as lost contact with health care providers and drug stock-outs, people will need to switch to other medicines to protect their health. ART enables people living with HIV to lead healthy, productive lives.

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) is impossible without clearly identifying the role of hospitals and optimizing their performance. Nevertheless, countries continue to struggle to improve hospital planning and management. Facility-level challenges such as weak management, escalating costs, long waiting periods, poor quality and safety, and low patient satisfaction impair hospital performance. At the level of the health system, challenges such as limited integration with primary health care, fragmented funding, weak regulation and inadequate monitoring undermine hospitals’ contributions to population health outcomes. These challenges occur against the backdrop of rapid population ageing, predominance of chronic health conditions, fiscal pressures, new medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, proliferation of private health care providers and growing public expectations. Given the vital importance of hospitals and persistent challenges, improving hospital planning and management has become a critical issue for countries in the Western Pacific Region.

        "title": "Human rights WPRO",
        "content": "Human rights are universal rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The WHO Constitution was the first international instrument to enshrine the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being. In international human rights law, the right to health is a claim to a set of social arrangements – norms, institutions, laws and an enabling environment – that can best secure the enjoyment of this right. The right to health is an inclusive right, extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to health information, access to water and food, and housing. The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity or any other factor. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory laws, practices or policies. Violations or lack of attention to human rights can have serious health consequences for many, including people with disabilities, indigenous populations, women living with HIV, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender and intersex people. Health policies and programmes must therefore be designed and implemented through a human rights-based approach to improve the enjoyment of all people to the right to health. The human rights-based approach (HRBA) to sustainable development can be summarized as: Goal: All development cooperation activities should respect and advance human rights. Process: Human rights standards and principles should guide all development cooperation and programming activities from start to finish. Outcome: Development cooperation activities should contribute to states respecting, protecting and fulfilling their human rights obligations and ensuring all people can claim their human rights. The human rights-based approach: Employs an intersectoral analysis to identify the inequities which lie at the heart of development and works to end discriminatory processes and practices, gender inequality and unjust distributions of power that lead to groups of people being left behind; requires that the human rights principles of universality, participation, accountability, equality and non-discrimination anchor development work focuses on developing the capacities of states and partners to advance and respect rights and the ability of people to claim their rights; ensures that plans, policies and processes of development cooperation are anchored in international human rights law, and advance and respect civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights and requires that states and partners are accountable for their international human rights obligations. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States to ensure a human rights-based approach is applied across the design and implementation of health policies and programmes by: Strengthening the capacity of WHO and its Member States to integrate a human-rights based approach to health, including adopting practical steps to strengthen the quality, access, affordability and availability of health information and services; Engaging in technical collaboration to build national capacity through the development and implementation of relevant policies and programmes that advance the right to health through targeting discriminatory practices and addressing unjust power relations; Promoting free, meaningful and effective participation of all concerned stakeholders including non-state actors and men, women, boys and girls of diverse groups in the development and implementation of health policies or programmes that affect them; Advocating for health-related human rights, including the right to health in accordance with international law and international development processes.

        "title": "Hypertension WPRO",
        "content": "Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability. It disproportionately affects populations in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are weak. Hypertension rarely causes symptoms in the early stages and many people go undiagnosed. Those who are diagnosed may not have access to treatment and may not be able to successfully control their illness over the long term. There are significant health and economic gains attached to early detection, adequate treatment and good control of hypertension. Addressing behavioural risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity and tobacco use, can prevent hypertension. If no action is taken to reduce exposure to these factors, cardiovascular disease incidence, including hypertension, will increase. Many people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death. Hypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flood of blood and oxygen to the heart. Detecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions. Reducing modifiable risk factors is the best way to prevent hypertension and associated diseases of the heart, brain, kidney and other organs. These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults. There are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors. Hypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions. Cessation of tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as improvements in diet and exercise, can help reduce symptoms and risk factors from hypertension.

        "content": "No one should get an infection while providing or receiving health care. Yet, healthcare-associated infections are among the most frequent adverse events occurring in the context of health service delivery. WHO estimates that 1 in 10 patients get an infection while receiving care. These infections, many of which are caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, harm patients, visitors and health workers, and place a significant burden on health systems, including the associated increased costs. By ensuring standard precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC) in health-care facilities, such as hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, waste management, and prevention of needle-stick or sharps injuries, 35–70% of health care-associated infections could be prevented. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has concretely demonstrated how critical infection prevention and control, including immunization, mask wearing, physical distancing and proper ventilation, is to maintaining essential health services and ensuring patient and health worker safety. Strong IPC programmes with empowered and well-trained IPC focal points are necessary to providing quality health services to patients across the Western Pacific and preventing avoidable infections. WHO in the Western Pacific is supporting Member States in identifying the barriers to strong infection prevention and control programmes in countries, and providing strategic recommendations to support healthcare facilities to take a grounds-up approach in strengthening IPC compliance, reducing healthcare-associated infection risks, and improving the environment for all health workers to take action at each step of health care delivery.

        "content": "Zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian or swine influenza, normally spread in animals but can also infect humans. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections (fever and cough), to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (breathing difficulties), shock and even death. Conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and encephalopathy (brain damage or disease) have also been reported to varying degrees depending on subtype. While recently identified avian influenza viruses do not currently transmit easily from person to person, the ongoing circulation of these viruses in poultry is particularly concerning, as these viruses cause severe disease in humans and have the potential to mutate to become more contagious between people. Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more frequently in A(H5N1) infection. Conjunctivitis has also been reported in influenza A(H7). Disease features such as the incubation period, severity of symptoms and clinical outcome varies by the virus causing infection but mainly manifests with respiratory symptoms. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs , notably neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival, however ongoing clinical studies are needed.

The virus can be passed on from an infected person’s mouth or nose in droplets when they speak, cough and sneeze. It can also be transmitted when a person touches an object contaminated with flu viruses and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes. Influenza is a year-round disease burden Influenza causes various illnesses that can lead to hospitalization or, in extreme cases, death. WHO estimates it causes 290 000 to 650 000 deaths yearly due to respiratory diseases alone. Most influenza-related deaths in developed countries occur among people aged 65 and up. Meanwhile, research estimates that developing countries account for 99% of deaths in children under 5 with influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections. From an economic standpoint, a study predicted that the yearly cost of influenza pandemics is US$ 60 billion. More information about the disease burden of influenza may be accessed here . Symptoms are usually mild but can also be severe Influenza symptoms are usually mild but can also be severe, especially among high-risk individuals. Symptoms include: Fever Cough Runny nose Sore throat Fatigue (tiredness) Headache Muscle and body aches Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without needing medical attention. However, influenza can also cause severe illness or death, especially in people at high risk: Pregnant women Children aged between 6 months to 5 years Older adults (aged 65 and older) Individuals with chronic medical conditions Healthcare providers Prevention is better than cure Vaccination is the most effective way to keep the flu away. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 60 years. The flu vaccine is recommended for all. It is vital for people at high risk of influenza complications and those who live with or care for those at high risk. It is safe to get your flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine simultaneously. To prevent transmission, people are also encouraged to take the following actions: Keep hands clean by regularly washing them with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub. Cover coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or a tissue and dispose of the used tissue correctly. Self-isolate if feeling unwell, especially when experiencing flu symptoms Avoid close contact with a sick person Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth Treating influenza In most cases, relieving influenza symptoms helps treat the disease.

        "title": "Intestinal Worms WPRO",
        "content": "Intestinal worms or soil-transmitted helminthiases are caused by infection with the nematodes Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), and Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus (hookworms) and are among the commonest infections in humans. Those living in poverty are most vulnerable to infection. Intestinal worms are among the most common infections worldwide and affect the poorest and most deprived communities. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor. Intestinal worms are a major public health problem because the worms disrupt people’s ability to absorb nutrients, impeding the growth and physical development of millions of children. Deworming programmes with a single-tablet treatment can drastically reduce the suffering of those infected with parasitic intestinal worms and improve the health and nutrient uptake of heavily infected children. Improving basic hygiene, sanitation, health education, and providing access to safe drinking water are also keys to resolving the health and nutritional problems caused by intestinal worms. 13 countries in the Western Pacific Region require interventions and only 6 countries are implementing and reporting interventions. These countries include Cook Islands, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Philippines, Tuvalu and Viet Nam (where education ministries take a lead and ministry of health supplies medicines donated via WHO). Other countries, such as Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are also gradually scaling up, though involvement/leadership of education ministry is still limited. Cambodia and Viet Nam are covering women of child-bearing age also. Regular deworming of preschoolers is mainly supported by UNICEF using mebendazole. Morbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness, and impaired growth and physical development. Infections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically. S. stercoralis may cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children. In case of reduced host immunity, the parasite can cause the hyperinfection/dissemination syndrome that is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and is often fatal despite the treatment. In 2001, delegates at the World Health Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution (WHA54.19) urging endemic countries to start seriously tackling worms, specifically schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths. The strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth infections is to control morbidity through the periodic treatment of at-risk people living in endemic areas. People at risk are: preschool children school-age children women of reproductive age (including pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women) adults in certain high-risk occupations such as tea-pickers or miners. The WHO recommended medicines –albendazole (400 mg) and mebendazole (500 mg) – are effective, inexpensive, and easy to administer by non-medical personnel (e.g. teachers).

        "title": "Leishmaniasis WPRO",
        "content": "Leishmaniasis is caused by parasites that are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. There are three main forms of leishmaniases: – visceral (also known as kala-azar and the most serious form of the disease), cutaneous (the most common), and mucocutaneous. Depending on the type of leishmaniasis, symptoms can range from fever, weight loss, lesions and life-long scaring, and partial or total destruction of mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and throat. Kala-azar is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. Leishmaniasis is linked to environmental changes such as deforestation, building of dams, irrigation schemes, and urbanization. It affects some of the poorest people on earth, and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system, and lack of financial resources. Leishmaniasis is a treatable and curable disease. The Western Pacific Region is not endemic for Leishmaniasis although China is considered endemic with very low endemicity. No data has been reported in the last two years. Only 5 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were reported in 2015. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. There may be many lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability. When the ulcers heal, they invariably leave permanent scars, which can lead to stigmatization, especially for women and girls. Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver and serious anaemia. If the disease is not treated, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% within 2 years. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis produces lesions that can partially or totally destroy the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. This disabling form can also lead to social exclusion. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a complication of visceral leishmaniasis, is mainly seen in east Africa and south-east Asia. It is characterized by a discoloured (hypopigmented) flat skin (macular) rash, combined with some slightly elevated (maculopapular) or elevated (nodular) rash, usually in patients who have recovered from visceral leishmaniasis. PKDL usually appears 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of visceral leishmaniasis. It may occur earlier or even concurrently with visceral leishmaniasis, especially in Sudan. PKDL heals spontaneously in most cases in Africa but rarely in patients in India. Antileishmanial treatment depends on the causative species and the condition of the patient (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression). Regardless of the causative Leishmania species, antileishmanial treatment cannot provide a sterile cure, and the parasite remains in the human body and can cause a relapse when there is immunosuppression. Treatment is complex and should be administered by highly experienced health personnel. Most antileishmanial medicines are injectable.

It is transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with untreated cases, but is not highly infectious. Mycobacterium leprae multiplies very slowly with an incubation period of about five years, but symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. If left untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. Leprosy is curable, and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability. Early diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT) remain the key elements in eliminating the disease as a public health concern. Since 1995, WHO has made MDT available free of charge to all patients worldwide. Symptoms may occur within 1 year but can also take as long as 20 years or even more to occur. Clinical signs are easy to observe. Skin lesion has usually a different pigmentation than the surrounding normal skin (less pigmented, reddish or copper-coloured) and may have various aspects (flat, raised or nodules). Skin lesion can be single or multiple and may show a loss of sensation in the skin. Skin smears are also used to diagnose leprosy. Leprosy can be classified on the basis of clinical manifestations and skin smear results. In the classification based on skin smears, patients showing negative smears at all sites are said to have paucibacillary leprosy (PB), while those showing positive smears at any site are said to have multibacillary leprosy (MB). Leprosy is curable with a combination of drugs known as multi-drug therapy (MDT), as the treatment of leprosy with only one anti-leprosy drug (monotherapy) will result in development of drug resistance to that drug. The combination of drugs used in the MDT depends on the classification of the disease (paucibacillary or multibacillary leprosy).

        "title": "Lymphatic filariasis WPRO",
        "content": "Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that can result in an altered lymphatic system and the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability, and social stigma. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The majority of infections show no external signs of infection, but they still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys, as well as alter the body’s immune system. When lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions, it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). In the Western Pacific Region, 24 of 37 countries and areas were endemic for lymphatic filariasis as of 2000. Since then, 13 of the 24 countries and areas have eliminated the disease as a public health problem. These countries include the following: Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Niue and Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Republic of Korea, Tonga, Viet Nam, and Wallis and Futuna. Other endemic countries are making progress toward elimination. Almost all the remaining endemic countries use a triple drug regime composed of three drugs for preventive chemotherapy campaigns called Mass Drug Administration (MDA). Brunei and the Federated States of Micronesia are in the last stages and are positioning for submitting dossiers for validation of elimination of the disease as a public health problem if the surveys show that the disease is no longer a public health problem. Whereas the disease was once thought to affect only adults, it now appears that most infections are acquired in childhood. Initial infection is followed by a long period of subclinical disease, which progresses in later life to clinically manifest disease. Lymphatic filariasis can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, that can be grouped into three categories: acute attacks, lymphoedema, and hydrocoele. The adult filarial worms cause inflammation of the lymphatic system leading to lymphatic vessel damage, even in asymptomatic people, and lymphatic dysfunction, which predispose the lower limbs in particular to recurrent bacterial infection. These secondary infections provoke “acute attacks”, which are the commonest symptom of lymphatic filariasis and play an important role in the progression of lymphoedema. Acute attack is usually associated with local pain, swelling, fever, and chills. Lymphoedema occurs primarily in the lower limbs and is common in women. In its most advanced form, lymphoedema may prevent people from carrying out their normal daily activities. Lymphatic filariasis may also evolve towards a genital disease (hydrocoele) that is characterized by a swelling of the scrotum and penis. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them suffer from damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and from an altered body's immune system. People infected with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also involves the Management of Morbidity and Disability Prevention (MMDP) that includes simple hygiene measures, such as basic skin care and exercise prevent acute attacks and progression of lymphoedema, and prevention of skin infections. For management of hydrocoele, surgery may be appropriate. MMDP also includes psychological and socioeconomic support for people with disabling conditions to ensure that they have equal access to rehabilitation services and opportunities for health, education and income. Activities beyond medical care and rehabilitation include promoting positive attitudes towards people with disabilities, preventing the causes of disabilities, providing education and training, supporting local initiatives, and supporting micro- and macro-income-generating schemes. Preventive chemotherapy is used at the community level to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt the transmission of infection by mosquitoes.

        "content": "Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, and vomiting, and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite. If not treated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening by disrupting the blood supply to vital organs. Malaria is preventable and curable. Control measures including insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying can prevent and reduce malaria transmission. Early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment of malaria reduces disease and can help prevent malaria related deaths. The best available treatment, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). In the Western Pacific Region, the key challenges to eliminate malaria include reaching the most vulnerable and unreached populations in remote and high-risk areas, preventing relapse of vivax malaria through compliant radical cure and halting transmission of knowlesi zoonotic malaria in Malaysia. Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, and lead to death. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur. Some population groups are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria, and developing severe disease, than others. These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers. National malaria control programmes need to take special measures to protect these population groups from malaria infection, taking into consideration their specific circumstances. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths, and also contributes to reducing transmission. The best available treatment, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Primaquine is used to treat liver-stage vivax malaria infections, often after determining deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) as a potential risk of side effects. For travellers, malaria can be prevented through chemoprophylaxis, which suppresses the blood stage of malaria infections, thereby preventing malaria disease. Prior to their travel to malaria-endemic countries or regions, individuals should consult their national disease control centres, or other institutions offering travel advice, for information regarding the preventive measures that should be taken. See also the WHO International travel and health WHO recommends protection for all people at risk of malaria with effective malaria vector control.

Many countries in the Western Pacific Region continue to struggle with undernutrition, especially affecting infants. Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning with exclusive breastfeeding until six months, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health.

        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every pregnant woman receives safe and high-quality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal period. In collaboration with Member States, WHO promotes universal access to high-quality maternal health-care services, in alignment with the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health and Every Woman and Every Newborn initiative. Severe bleeding, high blood pressure, pregnancy-related infections, complications from unsafe abortion, and underlying conditions exacerbated by pregnancy are common causes of maternal deaths. Notably, most of these causes are preventable and manageable with access to high-quality and people-centred health care. WHO emphasizes the following strategies to enhance maternal health outcomes: Evidence-based policies: Developing and implementing effective and data-driven policies and strategies; Access to services: Expanding access to affordable, equitable and high-quality family planning, reproductive, and maternal health services; Effective interventions: Applying evidence-informed and practical health interventions throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period; Women’s health and nutrition: Improving the health and nutritional status of women of all ages, especially pregnant and nursing women; Community engagement: Engaging and empowering women, families and communities to support maternal health; Social determinants of health: Improving conditions in which girls are born and grow, women live, work and age, beyond the health sector Partnerships and investments: Strengthening partnerships to promote women’s health and well-being and increase investment in maternal and newborn health; Monitor progress and drive continuous improvement : Strengthen tracking system to monitor progress towards national, regional and global maternal targets while identifying gaps and areas for ongoing enhancement. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.1 aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030. In 2020, globally, 800 women died every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth which translates to approximately one death every two minutes. Despite a 42% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) over the last two decades in the Western Pacific Region, an estimated 8300 women died from maternal causes in 2020. Notably, significant inequalities persist across countries in the Region, with the lowest MMR at 3 per 100 000 live births compared to the highest MMR at 192 per 100 000 live births. Trends in MMR in the Region showed a notable decline, decreasing by 35.5% from 76 per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 49 in 2010. However, progress slowed significantly in the following decade with only a 10.2% reduction between 2010 and 2020, reaching 44 per 100 000 live births. Improving maternal health is a strategic priority of WHO, firmly grounded in a human rights-based approach and closely linked to advancing universal health coverage. WHO in the Western Pacific works in collaboration with Member States to strengthen health systems and institutional capacities by developing and supporting implementation of evidence-based national policies, strategies, guidelines, and clinical protocols. This includes operationalizing robust data systems for effective monitoring, enhancing health system capacity, and empowering women to actively engage in their health-care decisions. WHO works to strengthen access to high-quality, respectful services across the continuum of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care through establishing routine continuous quality improvement mechanisms at all levels. Stakeholders jointly review the current intrapartum and early postpartum care practices, identify the quality gaps, develop an action plan along with setting targets, and implement routine measures for monitoring and undertaking improvement actions. To reinforce these efforts, WHO supports country-tailored support focused on providing high-quality basic antenatal, childbirth and early postnatal care to prevent and manage leading causes of maternal mortality properly and timely. WHO also promotes the integration of competency-based training packages into pre-service and in-service curricula, ensuring that future generations of health-care providers are equipped with the essential skills to deliver safe, dignified and respectful, high-quality maternal care.

        "title": "Measles and rubella WPRO",
        "content": "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Rubella is a contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. The virus is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome. Over the past decade, measles and rubella cases have decreased dramatically in the Region, as millions of babies and young children have been reached with measles- and rubella-containing vaccines. However, outbreaks have occurred among children and adults in several countries, and children have missed routine immunizations due to health service disruptions and postponements of immunization campaigns during the pandemic. In 2017, the Regional Committee endorsed the new Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific , and urged Member States to eliminate rubella as soon as possible, and for each Member State to set individual target dates for rubella elimination. Eight countries and areas have been verified for measles elimination and 7 for rubella elimination. Measles cases went up 255% from 2022 to 2023 in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region, an increase caused by gaps in vaccination coverage and disease surveillance and travel of people from countries experiencing outbreaks. Measles is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Rubella is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. In children, initial symptoms include rash, low fever (<39°C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50–80% of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 1–3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3–10 days. Once a person is infected, the rubella virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1–5 days after the appearance of the rash. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90% chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause the death of the fetus, or it may cause congenital rubella syndrome. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome may excrete the virus for a year or more. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles or rubella, but the diseases are preventable by vaccination. Measles and rubella can be prevented through safe, effective and inexpensive vaccines. Rubella vaccines are available either in monovalent formulation (a vaccine directed at only one pathogen) or more commonly in combinations with other vaccines such as with vaccines against measles (MR), measles and mumps (MMR), or measles, mumps and varicella (MMRV). Reaching all children with 2 doses of measles vaccine, either alone, or in a measles-rubella (MR), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) combination, should be the standard for all national immunization programmes. Routine measles and rubella vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with low routine coverage, are key public health strategies to eliminate measles and rubella.

        "content": "Several different bacteria can cause meningitis. Meningococcal meningitis is of particular importance due to its potential to cause large epidemics. Bacteria are transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers. The disease can affect anyone of any age, but mainly affects babies, preschool children and young people. The most common symptoms are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. If untreated, meningococcal meningitis is fatal in 50% of cases and may result in brain damage, hearing loss or disability in 10% to 20% of survivors. While vaccines against meningococcal disease have been available for more than 40 years, to date no universal vaccine against meningococcal disease exists. The largest burden of meningococcal meningitis occurs in the meningitis belt, an area of sub-Saharan Africa, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. The most common symptoms of meningitis are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. Even with early diagnosis and adequate treatment, 5% to 10% of patients die, typically within 24 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Bacterial meningitis may result in brain damage, hearing loss or a learning disability in 10% to 20% of survivors. A less common, but even more severe (and often fatal), form of meningococcal disease is meningococcal septicaemia, which is characterized by a haemorrhagic rash and rapid circulatory collapse. Meningococcal disease is potentially fatal and is a medical emergency. Admission to a hospital or health centre is necessary and appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible. Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible, ideally after the lumbar puncture has been carried out if such a puncture can be performed immediately. If treatment is started prior to the lumbar puncture it may be difficult to grow the bacteria from the spinal fluid and confirm the diagnosis. However, confirmation of the diagnosis should not delay treatment. A range of antibiotics can treat the infection, including penicillin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone.

        "content": "Mental health is critically important for everyone, everywhere, and goes beyond the mere absence of a mental health condition. It is integral to well-being, enabling people to realize their full potential, show resilience amidst adversity, be productive across the various settings of daily life, form meaningful relationships and contribute to their communities. Physical, psychological, social, cultural, spiritual and other interrelated factors contribute to mental health, and there are inseparable links between mental and physical health. Promoting and protecting mental health is also critical to a well-functioning society. It fosters social capital and solidarity, which are essential during times of crisis. The Western Pacific Region faces a looming mental health crisis, driven by social pressures, vulnerabilities and unrest, amplified by the wide ranging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities everywhere. Over 215 million people are living with a mental health condition in the Region. Suicide continues to be a leading cause of death among young people, and for every death, there are many more suicide attempts. At the same time, demographic shifts in some countries is increasing the proportion of older people contributing to the growing prevalence of dementia and other mental health conditions related to ageing. Rapid and unplanned urbanization give rise to built environments that are not conducive to health and well-being. Economic pressures, toxic online interactions and increased drug use can also cause stress and other direct threats to mental health. Substance use compounds the risk of developing a mental health condition and can lead to risky behavior especially among young people. Chronic exposure to adversity due to these and other risk factors increase the likelihood of developing a mental health condition across the life-course. The Region is also home to some of the most climate-vulnerable countries and areas in the world. Extreme weather events and other environmental hazards can lead to large-scale health emergencies and complex humanitarian crises, resulting in widespread mental distress and suffering. Communities residing in small islands and coastal areas are facing an uncertain future due to rising sea levels, leading many to feel anxious and afraid for their way of life. The new Regional Framework for the Future of Mental Health in the Western Pacific aims to promote the highest level of mental health for all people in the Region. It calls on Member States, partners and stakeholders to: Refocus the mental health agenda to include well-being and reaching the unreached through leadership that champions mental health for all.

        "title": "Newborn health WPRO",
        "content": "A newborn infant, or neonate, refers to a baby in the first 28 days of life, a period marked by the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Enhancing neonatal survival and health and preventing avoidable deaths and stillbirths requires achieving high coverage of quality antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care for both mothers and newborns. Neonatal deaths, which occur within the first 28 days of life, are often caused by conditions and diseases linked to poor quality care during pregnancy and childbirth and inadequate management immediately after birth and in the first week of life. The leading causes include preterm birth, birth asphyxia, infections, and congenital abnormalities. To accelerate progress in neonatal survival and promote overall health and well-being, it is essential to strengthen quality of care and ensure the availability of quality health services for well, small and sick child. Member States in the Western Pacific region have demonstrated a strong commitment to ending preventable neonatal deaths by introducing Early Essential Newborn Care – evidence-based, cost-effective and simple interventions proven to improve neonatal health outcomes. Global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.2 aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births by 2030. In the Action Plan for Healthy Newborn Infants in the Western Pacific Region , the Region aimed to reduce neonatal mortality to 10 or fewer per 1000 live births, extending the target up to 2030. Neonatal mortality in the Region has significantly dropped from 27.1 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 5.7 deaths per 1000 live births in 2022. However, 100 585 newborns still died in 2022 equivalent to one death every five minutes. Newborn death accounts for 52% of deaths in under-five children. Additionally, a stillbirth is defined as death of baby after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or during birth. In 2022, the stillbirth rate in the Region was 6 per 1000 births. Many of these stillbirths could be avoided through improved quality and respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth, including routine monitoring and timely referral to emergency care. The regional vision is to ensure a healthy start for every newborn. To achieve this, the Action Plan for Healthy Newborn Infants in the Western Pacific Region was endorsed as a road map for driving changes. Hence the Action Plan recommends evidence-based interventions that can be taken by governments and by development partners to improve neonatal survival and foster quality of newborn life. Nine priority countries, accounting for 95% of newborn deaths in the Region, have introduced and scaled up Early Essential Newborn Care (EENC) since 2013. This has led to significant improvements in practices including immediate and prolonged skin-to-skin contact, early and exclusive breastfeeding, delayed bathing, and Kangaroo Mother Care for preterm- and low-birthweight babies. In the past 10 years, EENC has been introduced in 6500 childbirth facilities, and more than 42 500 health-care providers have been coached. Five countries have successfully achieved the regional target of implementing EENC in 80% of childbirth facilities, while three more countries are on track. 93% of all term babies receive the first embrace immediately after birth. The regional result-oriented and data-driven approaches are to enhance quality of newborn care through applying routine monitoring and undertaking continuous quality improvement measures. Ensuring that no baby is left behind and giving every newborn the best start of life are core principles that support the vision of the Western Pacific Region with healthy families, communities and societies.

        "title": "Noncommunicable diseases WPRO",
        "content": "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are not passed from person to person. They are of long duration and generally slow progression. The four main types – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – impose a major and growing burden on health and development. In the Western Pacific Region, 12 million people died from NCDs in 2019. Despite progress in reducing premature deaths due to NCDs from 2000 to 2010, new risk factors and changing environments have reversed progress in some countries over the past decade. The main types of NCDs share modifiable behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and harmful use of alcohol, which lead to four metabolic/physiologic changes – raised blood pressure, overweight and obesity, raised blood glucose and raised cholesterol, and ultimately disease. They continue to be an important public health challenge in all countries, including low- and middle-income countries where more than three quarters of NCD deaths occur. One of the most important ways of reducing deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is to control the risk factors that lead to their development. These include reducing the use of tobacco and the harmful use of alcohol, maintaining an active lifestyle and consuming a healthy diet. Actions towards these goals are cost-effective ways for countries to reduce the number of NCD deaths. Tackling these risk factors can not only save lives, but also provide a huge economic boost for countries. Beyond prevention, management of NCDs is critical. This includes detection, screening and treatment of the diseases, as well as palliative care for those in need. The vast majority of premature deaths from NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries, where universal health coverage or access to health care services is often limited. The development and promotion of universal health coverage is therefore essential in tackling NCDs and working to reduce the number of preventable global deaths. Surveillance of NCDs is another vital action for providing the information needed for policy and programme development for NCD prevention and control. Tracking and reporting on NCD related global targets and indicators to understand progress in NCD prevention and control are key activities. Accurate data from countries are vital to reverse the global rise in death and disability from NCDs, to support evidence-based decision making, and to help monitor and evaluate the progress being made. WHO has worked alongside Member States, stakeholders, partners and experts to develop the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific , aimed at turning a “sick system” into a “health system” to end the NCD epidemic. It calls on Member States, partners and stakeholders to: Strengthen mechanisms for collection and use of data and information for planning, monitoring progress and evaluating NCD policies and programmes. Develop policies that go beyond the health sector to enable health-promoting environments and address social determinants of health at national and subnational levels. Screen populations for major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. • Strengthen primary health care to provide person-centred NCD management. Empower patients for self-management and adherence through health promotion, prevention and individualized data. WHO supports countries in adopting new solutions to the NCD epidemic through a regional “grounds-up” arrangement, in which the Regional Office or country offices identify common problems and help Member States develop customized solutions based on their local contexts.

        "content": "The health workforce is the backbone of the health system, and a competent and motivated health workforce, including nursing and midwifery, is central to providing quality healthcare services. Member States endorsed the WHO Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery 2021−2025 at the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly to optimise nurses’ and midwives’ contributions to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The Western Pacific Region has made good progress in strengthening the nursing and midwifery workforce. The density of nursing and midwifery personnel has increased in the last 20 years. Nurses and midwives make up two-thirds of health professionals. They play critical roles in various healthcare settings, ranging from tertiary care in hospitals to primary health care, where they are often the first and only contact point and health services provider to the people. However, many challenges remain to be addressed. The pandemic exacerbated the problems that marred nursing and midwifery, such as protection, fair working conditions, career pathways, retention, and migration. It poses a significant challenge for staffing in countries where human resources for health is already a challenge. In 2023, Member States endorsed the Regional Framework to Shape a Health Workforce for the Future of the Western Pacific at the Seventy-fourth session of the Regional Committee. The framework highlights nurses as a key enabler towards achieving UHC. It also provides priority actions to strengthen and retain the nursing workforce, including developing national nursing strategies, investing in nursing professionals, and enhancing quality-assurance mechanisms in education. The implementation of the framework will strengthen and protect nurses and midwives, allowing them to provide better and more efficient care, especially to vulnerable populations. An ageing population and the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases have continuously increased the demand for nurses in the Western Pacific Region. It is projected that the need will further increase in the future. These phenomena have also caused a change in the population's health needs. In response to the change, the healthcare delivery model has been transformed from hospital-centric to primary health care. Nurses and midwives need to be prepared for these changes. In the Region, people have experienced more frequent and harsh natural disasters, including cyclones, earthquakes, floods and bushfires, compared to the past. Emergency preparedness is critical to protect people, and nurses and midwives play central roles at the frontline once that situation happens. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the pre-existing hardships on nurses, forcing them to either quit the profession altogether or seek better opportunities internationally, which in turn is impacting the sustainability of health systems in vulnerable countries. The new Regional Framework to Shape a Health Workforce for the Future of the Western Pacific highlights nurses as a key enabler towards achieving UHC. It provides priority actions to strengthen and retain the nursing workforce: Develop national nursing strategies, invest in nursing professionals, and involve them in decision-making on nursing and health policies to ensure nurses optimally contribute to achieving UHC. Expand the scope of practice of nurses, including the introduction of nurse practitioners, to improve people’s access to PHC. Update and upgrade curricula for nurses to meet population health needs. Enhance quality-assurance mechanisms in education, including a licensing system and its renewal with continuing professional development (CPD) and accreditation mechanisms and with standards for education and institutions to protect the public.

Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity. Malnutrition, in all its forms, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries. WHO is providing scientific advice and decision-making tools that can help countries take action to address all forms of malnutrition to support health and wellbeing for all, at all ages. Essential nutrition actions to achieve optimum health and nutritional well-being are identified throughout the course of life. The Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition aim to end hunger and eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide. The two faces of malnutrition include undernutrition, such as wasting, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as those associated with dietary imbalance and excess, such as overweight, obesity, or diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). There is a potential of double-duty actions to effectively and simultaneously address the global challenge of double burden of malnutrition. Double-duty actions through integrated interventions, programmes and policies have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes across the spectrum of malnutrition.

WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed. Mothers should be counselled that the benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks for transmission. Childhood overweight and obesity In the Western Pacific Region, there has been a remarkable increase in childhood overweight and obesity over the past decades. Children and adolescents who are obese are more prone to becoming obese adults, and this poses an increased risk of serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Food marketing WHO supports country-specific actions to improve the food environment for children through multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The Regional Action Framework on Protecting Children from the Harmful Impact of Food Marketing aims to support Member States in their efforts to protect children from the harmful impact of food marketing, as appropriate to national contexts. It is guided by the principles of government leadership, evidence-driven and rights-based approaches, equity, and ensuring safeguards against conflicts of interest. Healthy diet While governments, policy makers and society can collectively act against overweight and obesity, it is also crucial to promote healthy diets among children and adolescents: eliminating excessive intake of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fatty acids. Together, we can all promote nutrition in building a healthier and more productive future generation. Infant and young child feeding Early initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour after birth, exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life, and introduction of nutritionally-adequate and safe complementary foods at 6 months together with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond have positive impact on the nutritional status, growth and development, health, and thus the very survival of infants and young children. Nutrition and COVID-19 During emergencies like COVID-19, appropriate and timely support to infant and young child feeding saves lives, protects child nutrition, health and development, and benefits mothers. WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed.

        "title": "Obesity WPRO",
        "content": "Obesity is one of the most serious global public health challenges of the 21st century, affecting every country in the Western Pacific Region. Obesity in adulthood is a major risk factor for the world’s leading causes of poor health and early death including cardiovascular disease, several common cancers, diabetes and osteoarthritis. Preventing obesity has direct benefits for health and wellbeing, in childhood and continuing into adulthood. Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. In adults, a body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In children aged between 5–19 years, overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median. In children under 5 years of age, overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median. Prevalence of overweight and obesity continue to grow in children and adults across countries in the Region. The epidemic has been growing most rapidly in lower-middle income and middle-income countries particularly in the Pacific island countries and areas. Although most countries are still off-track to meet the 2025 targets, many are taking action, and some have achieved a levelling-off in childhood obesity rates. Most countries in the Region are off track in achieving the global targets of halting overweight and obesity in children and adults. Obesity prevention requires action throughout the life course, starting before birth. Good nutrition in early life is crucial to lifelong health, and breastfeeding is recognized to protect against childhood obesity. For infants and young children, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years and beyond are recommended. These support not only reducing the risk of undernutrition and obesity but also to ensure optimal growth. For older children and adults, healthy eating habits such as limiting energy intake from total fats and sugars, increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity may prevent obesity. Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping people’s choices. By making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), overweight and obesity may be prevented. Key actions to improve healthy environments include regulating food marketing to children, nutrition labelling, fiscal policy, school nutrition policies, actions to support the early food environments, and promoting physical activity. WHO continues to support Member States in their efforts to address obesity in the Region. This includes technical support for the implementation of the \" Regional action framework on protecting children from the harmful impact of food marketing in the Western Pacific \". The Framework aims to support Member States to implement actions that effectively protect children from the marketing of food high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars or salt, and protect caregivers from the marketing of breast-milk substitutes and inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children. Additionally, WHO support Member States through the \"Regional action framework for noncommunicable disease prevention and control in the Western Pacific\". The Framework calls on governments to implement evidence-based, cost-effective policies and reorient their health systems to transform the current “sick system” to a “health system” where societies build health-enabling environments and health systems become more people-centred, accompanying individuals throughout their lives.

        "title": "Oral Health WHO WPRO",
        "content": "Oral health is essential to overall health, well-being, and quality of life across the life course. It enables us to eat, speak and socialize in the community. Most oral diseases are preventable and can be treated in their early stages. Through reducing risk factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diets high in free sugars, many oral diseases and leading noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, can be prevented. The burden of oral diseases is high in the Western Pacific Region. In 2019, an estimated 800 million people or 42% or the population were affected by oral diseases, including untreated dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal (gum) diseases, and tooth loss. Oral health promotion and oral disease prevention should be integrated with other noncommunicable disease prevention programmes that share common risk factors and social determinants. Also, integrating oral health services in primary health care is essential to provide more equitable access to comprehensive care. The most common oral diseases are dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal (gum) diseases, and oral cancer. Dental caries results from plaque that forms on a tooth surface and converts the free sugars from foods and drinks into acids that case a breakdown of tooth enamel over time. Unhealthy diets, including continuous consumption of free sugars, and poor oral hygiene lacking fluoride exposure and toothbrushing to remove plaque can lead to dental caries. Pain, infection and tooth loss can also result if not treated early. Periodontal disease includes gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis causes swollen, painful or bleeding gums and bad breath. In its more severe form, periodontitis causes a loss of connective tissue and bones resulting in tooth loss. The main causes of periodontal disease include poor oral hygiene and tobacco use. Oral cancer is cancer that develops in the lip and all parts of the oral cavity, and oropharynx. The initial symptoms include a persistent ulceration, pain, swelling, bleeding of the soft tissue, and difficulty in eating or speaking. The risk factors include tobacco use, areca nuts or betel quid chewing, and excessive alcohol consumption. Other oral diseases include cleft lip and palate, oral manifestation of HIV, and oro-dental trauma. Most oral diseases are preventable. Oral health promotion and oral disease prevention, such as national oral health campaigns, can be cost-effective and reach wider populations. However, investments in oral health are limited. According to the WHO Country Capacity Survey conducted in 2019, half of countries in the Western Pacific do not have an oral health policy, strategy or action plan. Moreover, oral health services are often not covered within universal health coverage benefit packages. Basic prevention methods, such as toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste are not affordable or widely available, especially for the most vulnerable populations. Since the Western Pacific Region has one of the largest and fastest growing older populations, oral health promotion should be accelerated in all countries to support healthy ageing. In 2021, Member States adopted an oral health resolution which recommends that countries shift their approach from focusing mostly on treating and curing oral health diseases towards prevention through promoting good oral hygiene, healthy eating and regular dental visits. This shift will contribute to addressing key risk factors of oral diseases and noncommunicable diseases in the Region. WHO in the Western Pacific assists Member States by advocating for oral health, providing technical support on development and implementation of national oral health policies, and supporting inclusion of oral health services into universal health coverage benefit packages.

        "title": "Patient safety in the Western Pacific",
        "content": "Patient safety is fundamental to the provision of health care in all settings. However, avoidable adverse events, errors and risks associated with health care remain major challenges for patient safety globally. Every point in the process of care-giving contains a certain degree of risk to patient safety. Adverse events, or safety mishaps, may result from problems in practice, products, procedures or systems. Patient safety incidents can also cause death and disability, and suffering for victims and their families. The financial and economic costs of safety lapses are high. Patient safety improvements demand a system-wide effort, involving actions in performance improvement, environmental safety and risk management, such as infection control, safe use of medicines, equipment safety, safe clinical practice and safe environment of care. Orienting health systems to the delivery and improvement of quality is fundamental to progress and to meeting the expectations of both populations and health care workers. Every year, large numbers of patients are harmed or die because of unsafe health care, creating a high burden of death and disability worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. On average, an estimated one in 10 patients is subject to an adverse event while receiving hospital care in high-income countries. Available evidence suggests that 134 million adverse events due to unsafe care occur in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries, contributing to around 2.6 million deaths every year. People mostly link patient safety with hospital-based care; however, unsafe care is a systemwide problem. Half of the global disease burden arising from patient harm originates in primary and ambulatory care. Unsafe medication practices and errors – such as incorrect dosages or infusions, unclear instructions, use of abbreviations and inappropriate or illegible prescriptions – are also a leading cause of avoidable harm in health care worldwide. Globally, the cost associated with medication errors has been estimated at US$ 42 billion a year. Recognizing the huge burden of patient harm in health care, the 72nd World Health Assembly, in May 2019, adopted a resolution (WHA72.6) on “Global action on patient safety”, which endorsed the establishment of World Patient Safety Day, to be observed every year on 17 September; and recognized “patient safety as a global health priority”. The resolution urges Member States to recognize patient safety as a key priority in health sector policies and programmes, and requests the Director-General of WHO to emphasize patient safety as a key strategic priority in WHO’s work, especially within the universal health coverage (UHC) agenda. The resolution also requests WHO’s Director-General “to formulate a global patient safety action plan in consultation with Member States, regional economic integration organizations and all relevant stakeholders, including in the private sector”. This plan will be based on the guiding principles of equity, sustainability and accountability. The proposed action plan will seek inspiration and coherence with existing global action plans developed by WHO and other global health and development agencies. Responding to the unprecedented global patient safety movement, the need for very urgent and concerted action in this area, and aligning with the Sustainable Developmental Goals, WHO’s Director-General launched the WHO Flagship Initiative “A Decade of Patient Safety 2020-2030” in February 2020.

        "content": "Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial disease of the respiratory tract. It occurs mainly in infants and young children. It is easily transmitted from person to person, mainly through droplets. In 2022, there were more than 62 500 cases of pertussis globally and nearly 39 000 cases were reported in the Western Pacific Region. Pertussis can be prevented by immunization. The Western Pacific Region had 93% coverage with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine in 2022. Pertussis is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis . Pertussis spreads easily from person to person mainly through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The disease is most dangerous in infants and is a significant cause of disease and death in this age group. The first symptoms generally appear 7-10 days after infection and include mild fever, runny nose and cough, which typically develops into a paroxysmal cough followed by a whooping noise (hence the common name of whooping cough). Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, and seizures and brain disease occur rarely. People with pertussis are most contagious up to about 3 weeks after the cough begins, and many children who contract pertussis have coughing spells that last 4 to 8 weeks. Antibiotics are used to treat the infection. The best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization. The three-dose primary series diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) (-containing) vaccines decrease the risk of severe pertussis in infancy. In 2022, 93% of the target population in the Western Pacific Region had received the recommended 3 doses of DTP-containing vaccine during infancy. WHO recommends the first dose be administered as early as 6 weeks of age; with subsequent doses given 4-8 weeks apart, at age 10-14 weeks and 14-18 weeks. A booster dose is recommended, preferably during the second year of life. Based on local epidemiology, further booster doses may be warranted later in life. Vaccination of pregnant women is effective in preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated. National programmes may consider vaccination of pregnant women with pertussis-containing vaccine as a strategy additional to routine primary infant pertussis vaccination in countries or settings with high or increasing infant morbidity/mortality from pertussis.

        "content": "Since 2000, the Western Pacific Region has maintained polio-free status. Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease caused by a poliovirus. It mainly affects children under 5 years of age but also can affect older age groups. Polioviruses are spread by faecal-to-oral and oral-to-oral transmission. Lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation is a major risk factor for transmission. Most infected people have no symptoms but can transmit infection to others by excreting the virus in their faeces. It is estimated that one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5–10% will die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. There is no cure for polio; however, it can be prevented by vaccination. Poliovirus is highly infectious. The incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. The virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It then invades the nervous system. Up to 90% of those infected experience no or mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized. In others, initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. These symptoms usually last for 2–10 days and most recovery is complete in almost all cases. However, in the remaining proportion of cases the virus causes paralysis, usually of the legs, which is most often permanent. Of those paralysed, 5-10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. There is no cure for polio; it can only be prevented by immunization. The polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. If enough people in a community are immunized against polio, the virus will be deprived of susceptible hosts and will die out. High levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks occurring. WHO is continuing to work with countries in the Region to stop the use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and use only inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization schedules, to prevent the emergence and circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses in the future.

        "title": "Primary health care in the Western Pacific",
        "content": "Primary health care (PHC) refers to a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution. This is through focusing on people’s needs as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. It should also be as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment. PHC comprises of comprehensive integrated health services; multi-sectoral policies and actions to address wider determinants of health; and empowering individuals and communities for increased participation in health. PHC aims to take a whole-of government approach to health with a strong focus on equity. It includes comprehensive interventions that encompass the entire life-course. It also addresses the broader determinants of health and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. WHO’s Western Pacific Regional Office along with its Country Offices is supporting countries to build health systems of the future oriented towards primary health care. This includes using evidence to provide advice on appropriate policies and actions to provide better-quality PHC services and address the social and economic determinants of health. WHO also continues to advocate for stronger political commitment and investment in primary health care across the Region. A rapidly ageing population, increased burden of noncommunicable diseases and health security risks, worsening economic outlook, and other changes in the Western Pacific Region are transforming peoples’ health today and into the future. These changes are compounding existing gaps in national health systems across the Region. Many countries face health worker shortages, many people are pushed into poverty due to excessive healthcare costs, and many groups still face barriers to accessing health services due to cost, location or other social and cultural factors. Primary health care of the future needs a stronger focus on empowering individuals and communities to participate in decisions that impact their health and to play a greater role in maintaining healthy lifestyles. Involving individuals and communities also works towards increasing the voices of marginalized and vulnerable groups in their care. There needs to be an enabling environment to harness innovations, both social and technological, to transform and improve primary health care design and delivery. This draws on the principle of human-centred design in how primary health care services are planned and delivered. As Member States aim to transform their health systems to meet these present and future challenges, adopting a new approach to primary health care will be essential. Primary health care for the future needs to build systems that not only treat illness but continually interact with patients and people to maintain health and well-being. Transforming health systems also means establishing health services that are tailored to the needs of individuals and rebuilding trust in primary health care. In partnership with Member States, WHO has developed the new Regional Framework on the Future of Primary Health Care in the Western Pacific. WHO is committed to primary health care as a top priority and an overarching vision for health sector transformation. It is also essential for global progress on universal health coverage (UHC). WHO advocates to Member States for more political commitment and greater investment in strengthening primary health care and works to engage other sectors that have a positive impact on health. WHO supports countries in developing national health policies, strategies and plans that focus on primary health care, and, where needed, it builds country capacity and facilitates joint learning. WHO provides tailored advice based on evidence to guide countries’ actions to provide better-quality services and reduce the barriers people face in accessing primary health care. WHO partners with other stakeholders at regional and country levels to support countries in implementing primary health-care reform in a way that matches their local context.

        "title": "Rabies",
        "content": "Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease. Dogs are the source of the vast majority of rabies virus transmission, through bites or scratches, usually via saliva. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. Clinically, it has two forms: Furious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations. Paralytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma. Rabies is classified as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) that predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations. In the Western Pacific Region, 7 countries, including Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philppines and Viet Nam, are considered high risk for rabies. Rabies elimination is feasible through vaccination of dogs, prevention of dog bites and ensuring universal access to post-exposure immunization. This requires a whole-of-system approach with a multisectoral interventions and community engagement. WHO closely collaborates and collaborates with the the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to support Member States in their efforts to eliminate rabies as a public health problem by 2030. Early symptoms of a rabies infection can include a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. In later states, the virus spreads to the central nervous system, causing fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The incubation period of the disease can vary from 1 week to 1 year, though it is typically 2–3 months. The two types of rabies show different symptoms. Furious rabies causes signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies, which accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases, runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and human rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, particularly a dog: Wash the wound immediately with soap or detergent. Flush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. Apply an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication to the wound 15 minutes after it has been washed and flushed. Avoid applying irritants to the wounds such as chili powder, plant juices, acids and alkalis. Avoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages. Seek transportation to a health care facility for further assessment and treatment by a healthcare professional. If possible, safely confine the biting animal and collect information on it and the bite circumstance to provide to the health care professional and public health officer. Keep the biting animal confined and under observation for 10 days. WHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs, dog bite prevention strategies, and more widespread use of the intradermal route for post-exposure prophylaxis, which reduces volume and therefore the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.

        "title": "Rehabilitation",
        "content": "Rehabilitation aims to support anyone with an injury, illness or development condition who experiences short- or long-term impairment and limitations in functioning. Rehabilitation can also be an important health service for people as they age, helping them remain active and independent for as long as possible. As part of the continuum of care, rehabilitation builds on curative interventions to help people address problems with communication, cognition, mobility, and self-care. Rehabilitation interventions may involve a combination of therapeutic techniques, environmental modification, and assistive technology, as well as education and advice. For many, it is an essential health service that enables participation in education, work and community life. It is estimated that 610 million – or 1 in 3 people - in the Western Pacific Region experience a health condition that could benefit from rehabilitation. The need for rehabilitation and assistive technology continues to grow as populations age; there are 245 million people 65 years and older in the Western Pacific, which is predicted to double by 2050. Rehabilitation needs are also increasing with the rise of noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke, cardiorespiratory diseases, and diabetes, which are the leading cause of death and disability in the Region. The high number of road traffic accidents further increases the risk of injury and trauma for which rehabilitation is required. While the need for rehabilitation is immense and continues to grow, services are often underdeveloped and undervalued, particularly when health systems are not strong. As a result, 50% of people are estimated to fail to receive the rehabilitation they need. Access to quality rehabilitation can profoundly impact individuals and their families, enabling people with health conditions to pursue education, work, and recreational goals. Rehabilitation also has an important economic and social impact because it can support people to live more independently for longer, reduce or prevent hospital admissions, and improve health outcomes. Rehabilitation is an essential part of emergency preparedness and response, which is highly relevant to many countries in the Western Pacific Region. Despite this, rehabilitation is too often neglected and avoidably disrupted when health emergencies strike. By embedding rehabilitation in emergency preparedness and response, people receive better care and individuals, families, and communities are better supported. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States in strengthening rehabilitation in their health system to ensure all people receive the care they need without financial hardship. The World Health Assembly 2023 resolution, “Strengthening rehabilitation in health systems”, demonstrates the importance of rehabilitation as a global health priority and a critical measure to advance universal health coverage. The Western Pacific Regional Framework on Rehabilitation highlights priorities, including action to address service availability and quality, governance and financing, workforce and data and research for rehabilitation. WHO implements the framework with Member States and development partners by providing technical support and guidance and reporting data that can help track progress and guide decision-making.

        "content": "Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children globally. It is transmitted through the oral-faecal route, directly from person to person, or indirectly through contaminated objects. People that are infected experience an abrupt onset of fever and vomiting followed by explosive, watery diarrhoea. Rotavirus diarrhoea is profuse, often leading to dehydration which can be severe, requiring hospitalization. The cornerstones of treatment of severe rotavirus diarrhoea are fluid replacement and zinc supplementation. Vaccines against rotavirus are available and vaccination is an important measure to reduce severe rotavirus-associated diarrhoea and mortality. Rotavirus causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting and severe dehydration in young children. Rotavirus diarrhoea is ubiquitous and, unlike bacterial diarrhoea, is not more prevalent in settings with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. Rotavirus peaks in cool, dry seasons in temperate climates but exhibits less pronounced seasonality in tropical settings. The clinical spectrum of rotavirus disease is wide, ranging from transient loose stools to severe diarrhoea and vomiting causing dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, shock, and death if rehydration is not provided. In typical cases, following an incubation period of 1–3 days, the onset of disease is abrupt, with fever and vomiting followed by watery diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal symptoms normally resolve within 3–7 days but may last for up to 2–3 weeks. Rotavirus has a case-fatality rate of approximately 2.5% among children in low-income countries who present to health facilities. This rate is higher in areas without good access to health care. WHO prequalified rotavirus vaccines have been available from 2008 and there are currently four vaccines available. They are all live, oral vaccines. RotaTeq, Rotavac, and ROTASIIL should be administered in a 3-dose schedule, while a 2-dose schedule should be used for Rotarix. A minimum interval of 4 weeks should be maintained between doses. WHO recommends that rotavirus vaccines should be included in all national immunization programmes and considered a priority, particularly in countries with high rotavirus gastroenteritis-associated fatality rates, such as in South and South-eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

        "title": "Scabies",
        "content": "Human scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The microscopic mite burrows into the skin and lays eggs, eventually triggering a host immune response that leads to intense itching and rash. Scabies occurs worldwide. However, it is the most vulnerable groups - young children and the elderly in resource-poor communities - who are especially susceptible to scabies and the secondary complications of infestation. The highest rates of infestation occur in countries with hot, tropical climates, especially in communities where overcrowding and poverty coexist, and where there is limited access to treatment. The most serious complications of the disease are rheumatic heart disease, sepsis, and kidney disease. Countries in the Western Pacific Region where the populations (nearly approximately 26.6 million) are at high risk include American Samoa, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Populations in some areas (for instance indigenous populations in Australia) of other countries are also at a lower risk. These countries include Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Brunei. The highest burden is Papua New Guinea where all the provinces are endemic. The disease is believed to be prevalent in other countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as Lao People's Democratic Republic) but the lack of proper mapping makes it challenging to understand the scale of the prevalence in these countries. As such, the major challenge facing scabies is the availability and quality of data on disease burden estimates. Sufficient evidence is available showing that mass drug administration with ivermectin can significantly suppress the burden of the disease to very low levels. Symptoms of scabies usually begin 4–6 weeks after infestation. Sometimes there are visible signs before symptoms begin. Symptoms of scabies include: Severe itch, often worse at night; Itchy lines (linear burrows) and bumps (papules) on the fingers, wrists, arms, legs and belt area; Enflamed bumps on male genitalia and female breasts; and Larger rash in infants and small children, including on the palms, soles of the feet, ankles, and scalp. Most individuals are infected with 10–15 mites. People with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) scabies. This severe infection can have thousands or millions of mites and causes dry, scaly areas on the skin. It often does not cause itch. Crusted scabies spread very easily and can cause secondary infections. It is life-threatening. Scabies mites burrow into the top layer of skin, where the adult female lays eggs. The eggs hatch in 3–4 days and develop into adult mites in 1–2 weeks. After 4–6 weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction to the presence of mite proteins and faeces in the scabies burrow, causing intense itch and rash. Mite effects on immunity, as well as the direct effects of scratching, can lead to inoculation of the skin with bacteria, leading to the development of impetigo (skin sores), especially in the tropics. Impetigo may become complicated by deeper skin infection such as abscesses or serious invasive diseases, including septicemia. Scabies can be treated with topical creams or oral medication in more severe cases. Itchiness often gets worse for 1–2 weeks after treatment starts. Topical treatments that are applied to the whole body include: 5% permethrin cream 0.5% malathion in aqueous base 10–25% benzyl benzoate emulsion 5–10% sulphur ointment. Ivermectin taken orally is also highly effective, but it should not be taken by pregnant women or children who weigh less than 15 kg. Treatments do not kill the parasite’s eggs, and treatment should be repeated to kill newly hatched mites. People do not experience symptoms in the early stages of infestation. To reduce spread, all people in the household should be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. Other treatments may be needed to treat the complications of scabies. Antiseptics or antibiotics are used to treat bacterial skin infections or impetigo. Patients with crusted scabies are highly infectious and a source of reinfection to the rest of the community. Patients with crusted scabies need intense treatment with both topical and oral medications.

Humans are infected when larval forms of the parasite penetrate the skin during contact with infested water. Schistosomiasis mostly affects poor and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing populations. Inadequate hygiene and contact with infected water make children especially vulnerable to infection. In the Western Pacific Region, intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum is endemic in China and the Philippines, and that caused by Schistosoma mekongi is endemic in two provinces in Cambodia and one province in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases. Elimination of schistosomiasis in the Region is targeted through community empowerment with the One Health approach, composed of health promotion, improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), preventive chemotherapy campaigns, treatment and management of domestic animals and livestock, and focal snail control. Community-led initiatives on WASH called Community-Led Initiative to Elimination Schistosomiasis through WASH-NTD collaboration (CL-SWASH), are being implemented in Cambodia and Lao PDR. Under CL-SWASH, communities voluntarily improve sanitation coverage in schistosomiasis-endemic communities, facilitated by WASH and neglected tropical disease teams. Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worms' eggs. Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases, there may also be enlargement of the spleen. The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anemia, stunting, and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Praziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood. Schistosomiasis control has been successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries around the world. With the support of partners, it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is required in several countries. In the Western Pacific Region, the governments of China and Switzerland have pledged funding to support the interruption of transmission of the disease in both Cambodia and Lao PDR.

        "title": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Western Pacific",
        "content": "There were an estimated 86 million new cases of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) in the Region in 2020. STIs can have serious reproductive health consequences, including infertility, mother-to-child transmission, adverse birth outcomes including stillbirths and newborn deaths, increased risk of HIV acquisition, and cancer. STIs are spread predominantly by sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some STIs can also be spread through non-sexual means, such as via blood or blood products, as well as from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. Common symptoms of STIs include vaginal discharge, urethral discharge or burning in men, genital ulcers, and abdominal pain. The majority of STIs have no symptoms.. Of the 8 most common STIs, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other 4 infections are caused by viruses and cannot be cured: hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV or herpes), HIV, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Symptoms or disease due to these viral infections can be reduced or modified through treatment. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs and HIV. Early diagnosis of STIs, among people with or without symptoms, offers the best opportunity for effective medical treatment and support, and for preventing further transmission. Vaccines can protect against hepatitis B and HPV. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women and nearly all cases of cervical cancer can be attributed to HPV infection. Chronic hepatitis B is a leading cause of liver cancer. HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis can be transmitted from infected mothers to their infants, causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, transmission of these infections can be prevented by simple and effective interventions, including the prevention of new infections among people of reproductive age, prevention of unintended pregnancies, antenatal screening, treatment of infected pregnant women, follow-up and vaccination of infants born to infected mothers. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. When present, common symptoms of STIs include: abnormal vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, genital ulcers and lumps, and lower abdominal pain. Symptoms of specific STIs are: Gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection These STIs cause cervicitis in women, urethritis in men and extra-genital infections, including rectal and oropharyngeal manifestations. Common symptoms include vaginal or penile discharge and burning with urination. Infants of infected mothers can contract neonatal conjunctivitis (red eyes) due to exposure to the STIs during vaginal delivery. Rectal and pharyngeal infections can be asymptomatic. Syphilis Syphilis is often asymptomatic, when symptoms occur, primary syphilis presents as a solitary, painless ulcer. Secondary syphilis may manifest as generalized lesions affecting skin, mucous membranes and lymph-node including a classic rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Latent syphilis is asymptomatic and characterized by positive syphilis serology. Trichomoniasis The predominant symptoms include abnormal vaginal discharge with redness of the vulva, itching and painful intercourse. Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) HSV most commonly presents as painful sores, vesicles or ulcerations on the external genitalia and mouth. Symptomatic genital HSV is a lifelong condition that can be characterized by frequent symptomatic recurrences. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Generally asymptomatic, the chronic form of HTLV-1 can cause severe disease, including adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a progressive nervous system condition known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs. Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are usually curable with existing, effective single-dose or multiple-dose regimens of antibiotics. For viral STIs (HIV, HSV and HTLV-1), the most effective medications available are antivirals or anti-cancer drugs (in the case of HTLV-1), that can modulate the course of the diseases, though they cannot cure these three diseases. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics used to treat STIs, in particular gonorrhoea, has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced successful treatment outcomes. Results from the current Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP) show trends of high rates of quinolone resistance, increasing azithromycin resistance and emerging resistance of extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The emergence of decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, together with established high-levels of resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make gonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism. AMR for other STIs, though less common, also exists, making prevention and prompt treatment critical. To adequately treat STIs it is important to take the appropriate antimicrobials, with the correct dose and duration for the specific STI to ensure adequate treatment or cure, and to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

        "url": "https://www.who.int/westernpacific/health-topics/snakebite",
        "title": "Snakebite envenoming",
        "content": "Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening disease that typically results from the injection of a mixture of different toxins (“venom”) following the bite of a venomous snake. Envenoming can also be caused by having venom sprayed into the eyes by certain species of snakes that have the ability to spit venom as a defence measure. Snake antivenoms are effective treatments to prevent or reverse most of the harmful effects of snakebite envenoming and are included in the WHO list of essential medicines. Most deaths and serious consequences from snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible, and raising awareness on primary prevention among communities and health workers. The snake species implicated in serious snakebite injury vary from region to region, a fact that increases the challenge of mitigating the burden of snakebite worldwide. Various species of venomous snakes are present in the Western Pacific with variations between and within countries. This diversity is partly attributable to biodiversity in the region. Throughout the rest of tropical Asia, a similar cohort of culprits occurs, and cobras (Naja ssp.), kraits (Bungarus ssp.) and Russell’s vipers (where they occur) are responsible for the lion’s share of serious bites. In Papua New Guinea, the taipan ( Oxyuranus scutellatus ) is responsible for the most bites, followed by the death adders ( Acanthophis spp.). Both groups of snakes occur also in parts of Australia, but bites in that country are very rare. The two major challenges facing snakebite response in the Western Pacific Region include: 1) inadequate mapping of snakebite envenoming; and 2) availability of antivenoms. Bites or sprayed venom from venomous snakes can cause a range of acute and serious medical emergencies. Envenoming from different types of snakes can cause different symptoms, some more serious than others. This makes the preparation of correct antivenoms an ongoing problem. Envenoming can cause severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, making immediate medical attention critical. People may also experience bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhages or irreversible kidney failure. Severe local tissue destruction may also occur, which can lead to permanent disability and even limb amputation. Children are at higher risk of severe effects due to lower body mass than adults. Snake antivenoms are effective treatments to prevent or reverse most of the harmful effects of snakebite envenoming and are included in the WHO list of essential medicines. The availability and accessibility of these antivenoms, along with raising awareness on primary prevention methods among communities and health workers, are the best ways to limit serious consequences and deaths from snakebite envenoming. After a bite by a snake suspected of being venomous, follow these steps: Immediately move away from the area where the bite occurred. Remove anything tight from around the bitten part of the body to avoid harm if swelling occurs. Reassure the victim, as most venomous snake bites do not cause immediate death. Immobilize the person completely and transport the person to a health facility as soon as possible Applying pressure at the bite site with a pressure pad may be suitable in some cases. Avoid traditional first aid methods or herbal medicines. Paracetamol may be given for local pain (which can be severe). Vomiting may occur, so place the person on their left side in the recovery position. Closely monitor airway and breathing and be ready to resuscitate if necessary.

        "title": "Suicide",
        "content": "In 2019, approximately 703 000 people died due to suicide globally, and 1 in 4 of these deaths occurred in the Western Pacific Region. Suicide is a major public health issue across a wide range of settings from highly developed to small Pacific island countries and areas. Suicide rates in some countries in the Western Pacific are among the highest in the world. The risk of suicide is particularly concerning among young people in Pacific island countries and areas. For every death due to suicide, there can be 20 times as many suicide attempts, creating lasting impacts among families and loved ones as well. If you are in crisis or know someone in danger of harming themselves, please contact your local emergency services. Suicides are preventable. LIVE LIFE, WHO’s approach to preventing suicide, outlines key actions towards developing a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. These include limiting access to means for suicide, interacting with media for responsible reporting of suicide, fostering socio-emotional life skills among adolescents, and early identification, assessment, management and follow-up of persons affected by suicidal behaviours. Additionally, it is critical to address factors that may increase the risk for poor mental health including, but not limited to, lack of access to care, economic insecurity, cultural norms, forced migration, social isolation and loneliness, stress, and climate change. Enhancing protective factors while reducing risk factors across the life course will contribute to preventing suicide. The new Regional Framework for the Future of Mental Health in the Western Pacific calls for a systems approach to promoting and protecting mental health, including the prevention of suicide. It envisions a Region where people enjoy the highest level of mental health and well-being, grounded in social solidarity for a transformative environment for mental health and well-being in the Western Pacific. The Framework identifies the following key strategies: 1) refocus the mental health agenda to include well-being and reaching the unreached through leadership that champions mental health for all; 2) transform mental health support and care into a community-based ecosystem of health and social services and innovations, enabled by a well-trained mental health workforce, delivering the full range of interventions, and underpinned by a responsive information system; and, 3) embed mental health into the settings and journeys of daily life by placing the well-being of communities at the centre and engaging partners within and beyond the health sector to help individuals, families and societies thrive and flourish. These strategies complement and are fully aligned with global goals and initiatives on preventing suicide. A series of technical resources and materials for various key stakeholders, e.g., programme managers, policy makers, health workers, media, content creators, and community organizers, have been developed to support the creation of policies, programmes and plans to prevent suicide.

        "title": "Tapeworm (Taeniasis and cysticercosis)",
        "content": "Adult tapeworms cause an intestinal infection called Taeniasis, of which Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) has a major impact on human health. Tapeworm eggs pass with the faeces and are infective for pigs. Humans can become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked, infected pork. Infection can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. While the adult tapeworm in the human intestine (taeniasis) does not have major health impacts cysticercosis can result in devastating effects on human health. The larvae may develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions, and epileptic seizures, and can be fatal. To prevent, control and possibly eliminate Taenia solium , proper public health interventions with an approach spanning veterinary, human health, and environmental sectors are required. Cysticercosis is a focal disease, affecting the poorest communities in which basic sanitation is deficient and pigs roam free. One of the first steps to control the disease is to identify those communities or endemic areas where control measures need to be implemented. WHO is assisting countries by providing protocols for mapping (identifying the endemic or high-risk areas), as well as assisting countries such as Cambodia in training diagnostic techniques that can be used for mapping. Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms associated with an intestinal infection (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, etc.). These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise, it may live for years. For cysticercosis, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions, infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin. Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia, and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system. The treatment of taeniasis by Taenia solium is important to prevent neurocysticercosis and as a tool to assist in controlling or stopping the parasite transmission cycle. The treatment can be done on an individual bases, or as mass drug administration depending on the local circumstances and the control approaches being implemented. Taeniasis can be treated using anthelmintics (Praziquantel, Niclosamide, Albendazole) In neurocysticercosis, since the destruction of cysts may lead to an inflammatory response, specialized treatment of active disease is required and may include long courses with high doses of anthelmintic, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs, and possibly surgery. The dosage and the duration of treatment can vary greatly and depend mainly on the number, size, location, and developmental stage of the cysts, their surrounding inflammatory edema, acuteness, and severity of clinical symptoms or signs.

        "title": "Tetanus",
        "content": "Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body's muscles and nerves. It typically arises from a skin wound that becomes contaminated by a bacterium which is often found in soil. Symptoms usually begin 3 to 21 days after the infection, and include headache and muscular stiffness in the jaw, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, rigidity of abdominal muscles, spasms, sweating and fever. As the toxin produced by the bacteria circulates more widely, it interferes with the normal activity of nerves throughout the body, leading to generalized muscle spasms. Without treatment, tetanus can be fatal. Vaccination is the best way to protect against tetanus. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or in adults who have not kept up to date on their booster shots. Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from 3 to 21 days after tetanus bacteria enter the body through a wound. Most cases occur within 14 days. Symptoms can include: jaw cramping or the inability to open the mouth muscle spasms often in the back, abdomen and extremities sudden painful muscle spasms often triggered by sudden noises trouble swallowing seizures headache fever and sweating changes in blood pressure or fast heart rate In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborn’s inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying. Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. Tetanus requires treatment in a medical facility, often in a referral hospital. People who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again and therefore need to be immunized. Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV), which are included in routine immunization programmes globally and administered during antenatal care contacts. To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV. The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years of age, and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. There are many kinds of vaccines used to protect against tetanus: diphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccines diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP) vaccines tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccines tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by immunizing women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of pregnancy. Additionally, robust medical practices can also prevent tetanus disease including clean delivery and cord care during childbirth, and proper wound care for surgical and dental procedures.

        "title": "Tobacco",
        "content": "Tobacco use is one of the world's leading preventable causes of death and is a major preventable risk factor of noncommunicable diseases like cancer, lung and heart diseases. The most common type of tobacco product used is manufactured cigarettes, but tobacco is also used in many other forms. Tobacco kills up to half of its users, and more than 7 million people each year lose their lives as a result of direct tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke. Health impact The Western Pacific Region is home to an estimated 368 million adult smokers (aged 15+ years) and nearly half of adult men are current tobacco smokers. Tobacco kills more than 3 million people in the Region each year, including over 550 000 non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Tobacco is a major driver of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), causing or exacerbating cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and other NCDs. Socio-economic impact Tobacco use has direct and indirect impacts on the economy. Globally, the total economic cost of smoking from direct healthcare costs and productivity loss (from mortality and morbidity cause by smoking-attributable diseases) are estimated to be around US$ 1.4 trillion per year, equivalent to 1.8% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Most deaths related to tobacco occur among working-age individuals, and these deaths are largely preventable with effective tobacco control and cessation services in place. Environmental impact Tobacco harms the environment throughout its lifecycle, from cultivation, production, distribution, consumption and post-consumer waste. It destroys our forests, wastes our safe drinking water, and pollutes our air. The harmful impacts continue to grow adding unnecessary pressure to our planet’s already scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. In the Western Pacific Region an estimated 1.2 million tonnes of plastic from tobacco product waste is discarded annually. WHO supports countries and areas to strengthen tobacco control by: Developing and implementing comprehensive tobacco control policies and measures Addressing emerging challenges, including new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products including electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems Preventing and countering tobacco industry interference Strengthening multisectoral surveillance and evidence-based research to support tobacco control Engaging with tobacco control partners beyond the health sector The current Regional Action Plan for Tobacco Control in the Western Pacific (2020-2030) provides a focused strategy towards full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and provides guidance to successfully face new challenges threatening effective tobacco control.

        "title": "Trachoma",
        "content": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world. It is caused by a bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis . The infection is transmitted through contact with eye and nose discharge of infected people, particularly young children who are the principal reservoir of infection. It is also spread by flies that have been in contact with the eyes and noses of infected people. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea. Blindness from trachoma is irreversible. Antibiotics can clear infection while maintaining facial cleanliness and improving access to water and sanitation are recommended preventative measures for endemic countries. In the Western Pacific Region, Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma remains endemic in four countries in the Region including Australia, Kiribati, Nauru, and Solomon Islands. Most of the endemic countries are implementing the SAFE strategy focusing on surgery, antibiotics, facial washing, and environmental improvement. Infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as “active trachoma”. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. After years of repeated episodes of active trachoma, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though the onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical. Women are blinded up to four times as often as men, probably due to more frequent contact with infected children. Individuals living in the poorest and most remote communities of Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Central and South America, and the Pacific islands are at risk. Trachoma can be prevented by limiting environmental risk factors. These include inadequate hygiene, crowded households, inadequate access to water, and inadequate access to and use of sanitation. Infections usually begin at an early age and grow less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infections are most often acquired through family and contact with others with active disease. Repeated infections cause the most serious symptoms of the disease. Trachoma can be eliminated as a public health problem using the SAFE strategy, comprising: Surgery to treat trachomatous trichiasis, the blinding stage of the disease; Antibiotics to clear the infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to national programmes through the International Trachoma Initiative; Facial cleanliness; and Environmental improvement, particularly better access to water and sanitation.

        "title": "Traditional medicine in the Western Pacific",
        "content": "Communities and families in the Western Pacific Region use traditional and complementary medicine extensively for a variety of health problems, from minor ailments to life-threatening diseases. It is sometimes the only available and affordable option, especially in remote or under-served areas. Thus, it plays an important role in primary health care. Traditional and complementary medicine is a health practice with strong historical and cultural roots. Since it has often evolved as part of a particular cultural heritage, the forms of traditional medicine vary widely across the Region. Some forms are highly developed and well documented. They are based on systematized knowledge, comprehensive methodology and historical experience. A number of less complex traditional medicine practices also exist within small and sometimes isolated ethnic groups, based largely on local experience. The knowledge may not be documented, often being transmitted orally from generation to generation. In the Western Pacific Region, traditional and complementary medicine is used extensively for various health conditions, but its practice varies widely across different countries. Evidence over the years has shown the important role of traditional and complementary medicine in improving quality of life. In the context of the rapidly ageing population and an increase in noncommunicable diseases in the Region, the promotion and development of traditional and complementary medicine can help bring a shift from disease-oriented to person- and community-oriented approach to health. However, the availability of and access to traditional and complementary medicine vary across countries in the Region, and their evidence-based use is not fully optimized. WHO plays an important role in supporting Member States to harness the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being. To help improve the access to safe, effective and culturally accepted services, especially for populations that are hard to reach, WHO developed the Regional Framework for Harnessing the Role of Traditional and Complementary Medicine for Achieving Health and Well-being in the Western Pacific . The Regional Framework, developed in close collaboration with Member States, stakeholders, partners and experts, identifies four strategic actions and key action areas to achieve this vision, namely: promoting the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being in national policies; strengthening context-specific mechanisms to ensure safety, quality and effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine services; improving coverage and equitable access to traditional and complementary medicine services; and supporting documentation, research and innovation for traditional and complementary medicine services.

        "title": "Tuberculosis WPRO",
        "content": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the world’s top infectious killer. According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2024 , in 2023, the Western Pacific saw an estimated 1.9 million TB cases and 95 000 deaths. TB is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. About one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB infection, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. However, persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill. People with active TB can infect 10–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment, 45% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die. The good news is that TB is curable and preventable. Common symptoms of TB disease include: Prolonged cough Chest pain Weakness or fatigue Weight loss Fever Night sweats Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, thus leading to delays in seeking care and increasing the risk of spreading the infection to others. If a healthcare provider suspects a patient has TB disease, they will send the patient for testing. In the case of suspected lung TB disease, patients will be asked to give a sputum sample to test for TB bacteria. For non-lung TB disease, samples of affected body fluids and tissue can be tested. WHO recommends rapid molecular diagnostic tests as initial tests for people showing signs and symptoms of TB. With TB infection, a person gets infected with TB bacteria that lie inactive in the body. This infection can develop into TB disease if their immune system weakens. People with TB infection do not show any signs or symptoms of TB. To identify TB infection, healthcare providers will screen at-risk patients to rule out active TB, and they may use a skin or blood test to check for TB infection. TB disease is curable. It can be treated with a standard 6-month course of 4 antibiotics. Common drugs include rifampicin and isoniazid. In some cases, the TB bacteria does not respond to the standard drugs. In this case, the patient has drug-resistant TB. Treatment for drug-resistant TB is longer and more complex. The course of TB drugs is provided to the patient with support by a health worker or trained volunteer. Without such support, treatment adherence can be difficult. If the treatment is not properly completed, the disease can become drug-resistant and can spread. In the case of TB infection (where the patient is infected with TB bacteria but not ill), TB preventive treatment can be given to stop the onset of disease. This treatment uses the same drugs for a shorter time. Recent treatment options have shortened the treatment duration to only 1 or 3 months, as compared to the previous 6-month regimen.

        "title": "Universal health coverage WPRO",
        "content": "Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all people and communities receive quality health services when and where they need them without suffering financial hardship. It covers the full spectrum of health services throughout the life-course, from promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. UHC requires strong and resilient health systems based on primary health care approach, as well as working with communities and other sectors to address the determinants of health. Although there are broad principles, good practices, and strategic directions for UHC, there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach—each country chooses its own path and pace, based on the context, even beyond health—fiscal, public administration, political, and cultural factors. Progress is incremental and can be accelerated with sustained political commitment, smarter investments, continuous monitoring, learning and evaluation, and course corrections. UHC is the overarching target of the Sustainable Development Goal on Health (SDG 3), central to achieving the Triple Billion targets globally and the foundation for realizing the For the Future vision in the Western Pacific Region. Over the past decade, countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region have made significant health gains in service coverage and increased commitments to advance UHC through various policy and programme interventions. However, financial protection has decreased especially with the interrelated challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2015, the Regional Committee of the Western Pacific endorsed the action framework that can guide countries in developing their UHC roadmaps based on taking concrete actions for improving the five interrelated attributes of high-performing health systems—quality, efficiency, equity, accountability, as well as sustainability and resilience. This has been reinforced in regional agendas and subsequently highlighted in taking systems approach and bringing together various health agendas towards the shared goal of improving health for all. As a foundation for UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Achieving UHC is a WHO strategic priority, with the goal of 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage by 2025. In countries with fragile health systems, we focus on technical assistance to build national institutions and service delivery to fill critical gaps in emergencies. In more robust health system settings, we drive public health impact towards health coverage for all through policy dialogue for the systems of the future and strategic support to improve performance. This work is supported by normative guidance and agreements; data, research and innovation; and leadership in the realms of diplomacy, advocacy, gender equality, health equity and human rights, multisectoral action, and finance. UHC is one of the targets that all UN Member States committed to achieving by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). UHC is not only an overarching target but also provides a unifying agenda for overall progress on SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being for all at all ages”. This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health services, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Globally, the UHC service coverage index (SCI) increased from 45 in 2000 to 68 in 2021, however the world has seen a stagnating pace of progress in recent years and no change since 2019, depriving millions of people of lifesaving and health-enhancing interventions. In the Western Pacific Region, UHC SCI increased from 49 to 79 during the same period. While there is improvement in coverage of essential services, financial protection declined as the percentage of households with catastrophic health expenditure increased from 9.8% to 19.8% in 2019. It is imperative to note that UHC progress across and within the countries in the Region considerably varies given the diversity of countries and shifting health demands. Regional averages can, however, mask actual variations across countries and areas, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO has a range of evidence-informed approaches, strategies, and tools to support countries get back on track towards the progressive realization of UHC and broader sustainable development goals.

        "content": "For over two centuries, vaccines have helped make the world safe—from the very first vaccine developed to protect against smallpox to the newest mRNA vaccines used to prevent severe cases of COVID-19. Every year, vaccines save millions of lives. Vaccines are available to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people live longer, healthier lives. They reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. Though immunization is widely recognized as one of the most successful and widespread tools we have to protect against vaccine-preventable diseases, not everyone has the same access to them. In the Western Pacific Region, nearly a million children missed out on basic vaccines through routine immunization services in 2023, the majority never receiving a single vaccine dose. Countries and areas in the Western Pacific continue to introduce new vaccinations for people of all ages. Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications. Vaccines protect against many different diseases, including: cervical cancer cholera COVID-19 diphtheria hepatitis B influenza Japanese encephalitis malaria measles meningitis mumps Pertussis pneumonia polio rabies rotavirus rubella tetanus typhoid varicella yellow fever Not all these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family. Progress has been made in the Region towards the control, elimination and eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases. As of 2024, eight countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region have achieved measles elimination, seven have achieved rubella elimination, 26 have successfully reduced chronic hepatitis B infection among children to <1%, and the Region has maintained polio-free status. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines were rapidly and safely rolled out, achieving high coverage in many countries and areas. Despite these successes, many people continue to be left behind by national immunization efforts. Immunity gaps led to the emergence, resurgence and large-scale, import-related outbreaks of several vaccine-preventable diseases in high-risk communities in the Region. Routine immunization programmes and vaccine-preventable disease surveillance systems were also seriously affected in many countries and areas amid the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO is working with countries and partners to improve regional vaccination coverage, including through these initiatives endorsed by the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2020. The Regional Strategic Framework for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Immunization in the Western Pacific 2021-2030 was developed to expand the scope of immunization, maximize the benefits of vaccines and immunization programmes, and further accelerate control, and achieve and sustain elimination of additional vaccine-preventable diseases beyond those traditionally targeted, aiming to make the Region free from vaccine-preventable morbidity, mortality and disability in the Western Pacific Region towards 2030.

        "content": "Interpersonal violence includes: Gender-based violence, including violence against women Intimate partner violence Sexual violence Abuse of older people Violence against children under age 18 and child maltreatment Youth violence Armed, criminal, and gang related violence. Interpersonal violence can directly contribute to injury, premature death and disability. It also contributes to a range of physical, sexual, reproductive, and emotional and mental health problems. Specific health-related impacts of violence on the individual include injury, suicide, or self-harm, chronic pain, unintended pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, anxiety, and other symptoms of trauma. Community well-being is impacted by violence. Populations living in communities with violence may be at increased risk of chronic stress and disease. Moreover, concerns about violence can prevent people from engaging in healthy behaviours like walking, bicycling or using recreational spaces. Responding to injuries as a result of violence also burdens emergency healthcare services. People’s health is shaped by the conditions in which they live, work, learn, play and age. Often people who are most vulnerable to interpersonal violence experience the greatest inequities. For instance, interpersonal violence is often prevalent in communities with economic instability, concentrated poverty, and limited housing; and the burden is most predominantly experienced by women, people who are LGBTQI+, children, and those who experience ethnic or racial discrimination. Violence not only costs countries billions of dollars in health care, law enforcement, and lost productivity globally each year, but it also undermines community well-being, gender equality, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Interpersonal violence is a violation of human rights and a pervasive public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased vulnerabilities to violence due to the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. In the Western Pacific Region, gender-based violence, such as sexual exploitation, most heavily burdens women and girls. An estimated 122 million girls and women aged 15-49 years in the Western Pacific having experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, mostly by someone they know. For many children in the Western Pacific, violence is a daily reality impacting their lifelong health and well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic the risk of violence against children increased when schools were closed and containment measures were imposed. In the Western Pacific Region, 99 people are victims of homicide every day, 95% of those killed are in low- and middle-income countries. WHO in the Western Pacific Region is committed to supporting the implementation of the Global Plan of Action which includes actions to strengthen health system and intersectoral actions to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence. This plan provides guidance on what Member States can do to prevent and respond to violence by strengthening health system leadership and governance; health service delivery and health workers’ capacity to respond to violence; prevention efforts led or supported by the health sector; and the evidence base by improving information collected through the health system.

        "content": "Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate hygiene (WASH) services is essential to population health, welfare and development. Preventable water-related diseases claim tens of thousands of lives in the Western Pacific Region. The Region made considerable progress from 1990 to 2018, with most countries achieving global targets for drinking-water and sanitation. Still, nearly 90 million people in the Region do not use a basic drinking-water facility and more than 400 million do not use a basic sanitation facility. Sufficient, affordable and safely managed drinking-water, sanitation, and improved hygiene behaviours can cut this number dramatically. In adopting the Sustainable Development Goals, the global community pledged to achieve universal coverage of safely managed drinking - water and sanitation services and to eradicate open defecation by 2030. Contaminated drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene are linked to the transmission of preventable diseases. This is true not only with the population in general but also particularly in healthcare facilities. Similarly, the inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater leads to major health hazards, due to direct exposure of humans to contamination or through microbial or chemical contamination of drinking watercourse. Globally, 1.4 million deaths and 74 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) could be prevented by access to clean water, adequate sanitation and proper hygiene. In 2019, more than 84 000 people died in the Western Pacific Region as a result of water-related diseases. Today, nearly 90 million individuals in the Western Pacific still lack access to safe drinking water facilities, and over 400 million people do not have access to basic sanitation services. Pacific island countries and areas, in particular, face significant challenges in terms of insufficient access to WASH resources. Climate change and water security are interconnected challenges that cannot be separated. The effects of climate change are evident in various aspects of water, including its availability, accessibility, quality, and stability. Every year, approximately 3.5 million deaths globally occur as a result of environmental-related factors, which include diseases transmitted through contaminated water. WHO in the Western Pacific works with Member States to improve access to safely managed drinking-water supply and sanitation, and good hygiene behaviours to protect health and well-being. WHO has been a major partner to relevant multilateral and bilateral agencies in the Region through organizing crucial high-level events and has facilitated important related international commitments. The regional vision, For the Future , outlines ensuring good water, sanitation and hygiene management practice in health facilities as a key component to mitigate the impacts of climate and environmental change on the national health systems. This presents a high-level strategic framework for the development of actions to strengthen WASH services in health care facilities throughout the Region. WHO works with countries to achieve the target of all health facilities having access to safely managed WASH services in the Region. Unfortunately, information about the status of WASH in healthcare facilities in the countries of Western Pacific Region is greatly missing. Efforts are being made to capture all the data exist in the Region, as well as to embed indicators for WASH in healthcare facilities into existing health monitoring systems to better inform the status. Regional programmatic priorities also highlight on ensuring drinking water quality. WHO supports the establishment of water safety plans and household water treatment and safe storage in Member States. This includes developing national strategies and increasing the capacity on implementing safe drinking water programs based on WHO guidelines.

        "title": "Yaws WPRO",
        "content": "Yaws is a chronic infectious disease, caused by the Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue , which affects the skin, bone and cartilage. If left untreated, it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. Transmission is through person-to-person contact of minor injuries. Poverty, low socio-economic conditions, and poor personal hygiene facilitate the spread of yaws. The disease is found primarily in poor communities in warm, humid, and tropical forest areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific. About 75 – 80% of people affected are children under 15 years of age. The discovery in 2012 that a single, oral dose of the antibiotic azithromycin can completely cure yaws has reopened the prospects of yaws eradication. Two countries in the Western Pacific Region, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, carry the heaviest burden of yaws in the world. In 2022, Papua New Guinea reported more than 96 000 clinical cases whereas Solomon Islands reported more than 12 000 cases. The two other countries endemic to yaws are Vanuatu and the Philippines. Vanuatu reported 690 clinical cases in 2022. The country is conducting integrated mass drug administrations to eliminate the disease. Reporting yaws cases from the Philippines is currently a challenge. There are two stages of yaws infection. The early stage is when the patient is infectious and can spread the disease to others. In this stage, a papule (a noncancerous, outward-growing lump) develops at the site of infection. This papule is full of organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Without treatment, this is followed by disseminated skin lesions over the body. Bone pain and bone lesions may also occur. The second stage is non-infectious and typically appears 5 years after infection. It is characterized by disabling consequences of the nose, bones, and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis (thickening). After a field diagnosis based on these symptoms, the disease can be confirmed by examining a sample from a skin legion under a special type of microscope (darkfield examination). Blood tests are not typically used because yaws is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis and the two diseases will show the same result. There is currently no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improved personal hygiene are the most important tactics for prevention. Two antibiotics can be used to treat yaws. A single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg, maximum 2 g) is the recommended treatment. Benzathine penicillin (single intramuscular dose) at 0.6 million units (children aged under 10 years) and 1.2 million units (people aged over 10 years) can be used for patients with suspected clinical treatment failure after azithromycin, or patients who cannot be treated with azithromycin. This treatment will result in complete clinical healing in 95% of cases but patients should be re-examined 4 weeks after receiving the antibiotics.

        "content": "Adolescent and young adult health Key facts Over 1.5 million adolescents and young adults aged 10–24 years died in 2021, about 4500 every day. Young adolescents aged 10–14 years have the lowest risk of death among all age groups. Injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning), interpersonal violence, self-harm and maternal conditions are the leading causes of death among adolescents and young adults. Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 18, but most cases are undetected and untreated. Early onset of substance use is associated with higher risks of developing dependence and other problems during adult life, and younger people are disproportionately affected by substance use compared with older people. Globally, there were 42 births per 1000 to girls aged 15–19 years in 2021. Overview Survival chances for adolescents and young adults vary greatly across the world. In 2021, the average probability of a 10-year-old dying before age 24 was about 6 times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in North America and Europe. Within the age group 10–24 years, mortality rates are lowest among adolescents aged 10–14, and highest among young adults aged 20–24 years. Females generally have lower mortality rates for these ages than males. The patterns of death of 10–14-year-olds are dominated by infectious diseases. Among older adolescents and young adults, a shift away from infectious diseases of childhood is seen, towards accidents and injuries, self-harm and interpersonal violence. Sex differences in mortality rates also become apparent in adolescence. Main health issues Many unintentional injuries such as road traffic and drowning are the leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. Road traffic accidents In 2021, over 100 000 adolescents (10–19 years) died from road traffic accidents . Many of those who died were vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists or users of motorized two-wheelers. Injuries and violence fact sheet In 2021, over 100 000 adolescents (10–19 years) died from road traffic accidents . Many of those who died were vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists or users of motorized two-wheelers. Injuries and violence fact sheet Drowning Drowning is also among the top causes of death among adolescents; more than 40 000 adolescents, over three quarters of them boys, are estimated to have drowned in 2021. Drowning fact sheet Drowning is also among the top causes of death among adolescents; more than 40 000 adolescents, over three quarters of them boys, are estimated to have drowned in 2021. Drowning fact sheet Violence Interpersonal violence is among the leading causes of death in adolescents and young people globally. Its prominence varies substantially by world region. It causes nearly a third of all adolescent male deaths in the WHO Region of the Americas. Violence during adolescence also increases the risks of injury, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems, poor school performance and dropout, early pregnancy, reproductive health problems, and communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Youth violence fact sheet Interpersonal violence is among the leading causes of death in adolescents and young people globally. It causes nearly a third of all adolescent male deaths in the WHO Region of the Americas. Violence during adolescence also increases the risks of injury, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems, poor school performance and dropout, early pregnancy, reproductive health problems, and communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Youth violence fact sheet Alcohol and drug use Drinking alcohol among adolescents is a major concern in many countries. Worldwide, more than a quarter of all people aged 15–19 years are current drinkers, amounting to 155 million adolescents. Prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among adolescents aged 15­–19 years was 13.6% in 2016, with males most at risk. Cannabis is the most widely used psychoactive drug among young people with about 4.7% of people aged 15–16 years using it at least once in 2018. Alcohol and drug use in children and adolescents is associated with neurocognitive alterations which can lead to behavioural, emotional, social and academic problems in later life.

Alcohol and drug use in children and adolescents is associated with neurocognitive alterations which can lead to behavioural, emotional, social and academic problems in later life. Alcohol fact sheet Tobacco use The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Globally in 2018, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13–15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher. E-cigarettes are particularly risky when used by children and adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties. Tobacco fact sheet E-cigarettes: how risky are they? Mental health Depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is among the leading causes of death in people aged 15–19 years. Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 18, but most cases are undetected and untreated. Many factors have an impact on the well-being and mental health of adolescents. Violence, poverty, stigma, exclusion, and living in humanitarian and fragile settings can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Adolescent mental health fact sheet Communicable diseases HIV An estimated 1.7 million adolescents (age 10–19 years) were living with HIV in 2021 with around 90% in the WHO African Region. While there have been substantial declines in new infections amongst adolescents from a peak in 1994, adolescents still account for about 10% of new HIV infections, with three-quarters amongst adolescent girls. Additionally, while new infections may have fallen in many of the most severely affected countries, recent testing coverage remains low suggesting that many adolescents and young people living with HIV may not know their status. HIV fact sheet HIV facts in pictures Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease, but it continues to impact the lives and development of millions of children and adolescents. Children and young adolescents aged under 15 years represent about 11% of all people with TB globally. This means 1.1 million children and young adolescents aged under 15 years fall ill with TB every year, and more than 225 000 of them lose their lives. Adolescents and young adults usually present with bacteriologically infectious TB characterized by cavities seen on chest x-rays. The Global Tuberculosis Report shows that notification rates in adolescents aged 15–19 years are relatively high compared with younger adolescents. Tuberculosis fact sheet Other infectious diseases Diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia) are estimated to be among the top five causes of death for adolescents 10–14 years, with mortality rates being particularly high in African low- and middle-income countries. Thanks to improved childhood vaccination, adolescent deaths and disability from measles have fallen markedly. Diarrhoeal disease fact sheet Pneumonia fact sheet Measles fact sheet Early adolescence (9–14 years) is the optimal time for vaccination against HPV infection and it is estimated that if 90% of girls globally get the HPV vaccine more than 40 million lives could be saved over the next century. However, it is estimated that in 2021 only 12% of girls globally received the vaccine. Human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer fact sheet Overall there are proportionally fewer cases of and deaths from COVID-19 disease for adolescents and young adults than for older adults. However, the pandemic has severe indirect negative effects on young people’s well-being, including on their mental health, loss of education time through school closures, social isolation, physical inactivity, malnutrition and domestic violence. Early pregnancy and childbirth Approximately 12 million girls aged 15–19 years and at least 777 000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in developing regions. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are among the leading causes of death for girls aged 15–19 years globally. The global adolescent birth rate in 2021 was 42 births per 1000 girls this age, and country rates range from 1 to over 200 births per 1000 girls annually. This indicates a marked decrease since 1990. This decrease is reflected in a similar decline in maternal mortality rates among girls aged 15–19 years. One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, the world should ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Adolescent pregnancy fact sheet Environmental health Many of the main causes of mortality in adolescents and young adults have strong links to the environment, including unintentional injuries and infectious diseases. Young people are at increased risk of environmental hazards and pollution due to their developmental physiology and immature systems. Primary environmental hazards and pollution affecting the health of adolescents and young adults include air pollution, chemicals and heavy metals, climate change, UV radiation, urban health and WASH. WHO's work on children's environmental health Overweight Globally, in 2016, over 1 in 6 adolescents aged 10–19 years was overweight. Prevalence varied across WHO regions, from lower than 10% in the WHO South-East Asia Region to over 30% in the WHO Region of the Americas. Obesity and overweight fact sheet Nutrition Many boys and girls in developing countries enter adolescence undernourished, making them more vulnerable to disease and early death. Iron deficiency anaemia was among the leading causes of healthy years of life lost due to disability by adolescents aged 10–19 in 2021. Iron and folic acid supplements are a solution that also helps to promote health of adolescents. Regular deworming in areas where intestinal helminths such as hookworm are common is recommended to prevent micronutrient (including iron) deficiencies. Malnutrition fact sheet Healthy diet fact sheet Physical activity Globally, in 2016, only 1 in 5 adolescents are estimated to meet WHO guidelines on physical activity. Prevalence of inactivity is high across all WHO regions, and higher in female as compared to male adolescents (8) . Physical activity fact sheet Rights of adolescents The rights of children under 18 years to survive, grow and develop are enshrined in international legal documents. In 2013, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) published guidelines on the right of children to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, and a General Comment on realizing the rights of children during adolescence was published in 2016. It highlights states’ obligations to recognize the special health and development needs and rights of young people. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) also sets out the rights of women and girls to health and adequate health care. WHO response WHO works with Member States and partners to improve the health of young people by producing evidence-based guidelines, advocating and providing recommendations for adolescent-responsive health systems, and documenting progress in adolescent health and development. In 2023, WHO published an update of the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!): Guidance to support country implementation . AA-HA! 2.0 has drawn on inputs received during consultations with Member States, United Nations agencies, adolescents and young people, civil society and other partners. It aims to assist governments in deciding what they plan to do and how they plan to do it as they respond to the health needs of adolescents. To improve adolescent health measurement globally, WHO in collaboration with UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFAP, UNICEF, UN Women, the World Bank Group, and the World Food Programme (WFP), has established the Global Action for Measurement of Adolescent health (GAMA) Advisory Group . A comprehensive set of 47 priority indicators for global, regional and national adolescent health measurement has been published in 2024 using a structured participatory process.

        "content": "Mental health of adolescents Key facts Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 15% of the global burden of disease in this age group. Depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among those aged 15–29 years old. The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults. Introduction One in six people are aged 10–19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood. Globally, it is estimated that one in seven (14.3%) of 10–19-year-olds experience mental health conditions (1) , yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. Adolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations. Mental health determinants Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important. Multiple factors affect mental health. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity between an adolescent’s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other important determinants include the quality of their home life and relationships with peers. Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health. Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups. Emotional disorders Emotional disorders are common among adolescents. Anxiety disorders (which may involve panic or excessive worry) are the most prevalent in this age group and are more common among older than among younger adolescents. It is estimated that 4.1% of 10–14-year-olds and 5.3% of 15–19-year-olds experience an anxiety disorder (1) . Depression is estimated to occur among 1.3% of adolescents aged 10–14 years, and 3.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Depression and anxiety share some of the same symptoms, including rapid and unexpected changes in mood. Anxiety and depressive disorders can profoundly affect school attendance and schoolwork. Social withdrawal can exacerbate isolation and loneliness. Depression can lead to suicide. Behavioural disorders Behavioural disorders are more common among younger adolescents than older adolescents. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by difficulty paying attention and/or excessive activity and acting without regard to consequences, occurs among 2.7% of 10–14-year-olds and 2.2% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Conduct disorder (involving symptoms of destructive or challenging behaviour) occurs among 3.3% of 10–14-year-olds and 1.8% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Behavioural disorders can affect adolescents’ education and increases the risk of criminal behaviour. Eating disorders Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food, accompanied in most instances by concerns about body weight and shape. Girls are more commonly affected than boys. Eating disorders can affect physical health and often co-exist with depression, anxiety and substance use disorders. They occur in an estimated 0.1% of 10–14-year-olds and 0.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1). They are associated with suicide. Anorexia nervosa can lead to premature death, often due to medical complications or suicide, and has higher mortality than any other mental disorder. Psychosis Conditions that include symptoms of psychosis most commonly emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can include hallucinations or delusions. These experiences can impair an adolescent’s ability to participate in daily life and education and often lead to stigma or human rights violations. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1% of 15–19-year-olds (1) . Suicide and self-harm Suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents and young adults (15–29 years) (2) . Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, and include harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma against help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to means of suicide. Digital media, like any other media, can play a significant role in either enhancing or weakening suicide prevention efforts. Risk-taking behaviours Many risk-taking behaviours for health, such as substance use or sexual risk-taking, start during adolescence. Risk-taking behaviours can be an unhelpful strategy to cope with emotional difficulties and can severely impact an adolescent’s mental and physical well-being. Young people are especially vulnerable to developing harmful substance use patterns that can persist across the lifespan. In 2019, the prevalence of alcohol use among 15–19-year-olds was high worldwide (22%) with very few gender differences, and showing an increase in consumption in some regions (3). The use of tobacco and cannabis are additional concerns. Many adult smokers had their first cigarette prior to the age of 18 years. In 2022, the prevalence of cannabis use among adolescents was higher than that of adults globally (5.5 per cent compared with 4.4 per cent, respectively) (4). Perpetration of violence is a risk-taking behaviour that can increase the likelihood of low educational attainment, injury, involvement with crime or death. Interpersonal violence was ranked among the leading causes of death of older adolescents in 2021 (1) . Promotion and prevention Mental health promotion and prevention interventions aim to strengthen an individual's capacity to regulate emotions, enhance alternatives to risk-taking behaviours, build resilience for managing difficult situations and adversity, and promote supportive social environments and social networks. These programmes require a multi-level approach with varied delivery platforms – for example, digital media, health or social care settings, schools or the community – and varied strategies to reach adolescents, particularly the most vulnerable. Early detection and treatment It is crucial to address the needs of adolescents with mental health conditions. Avoiding institutionalization and over-medicalization, prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches, and respecting the rights of children in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments are key for adolescents’ mental health. WHO response WHO works on strategies, programmes and tools to assist governments in responding to the health needs of adolescents. For example, the Helping Adolescents Thrive (HAT) Initiative is a joint WHO-UNICEF effort to strengthen policies and programmes for the mental health of adolescents. More specifically, the efforts made through the Initiative are to promote mental health and prevent mental health conditions. They are also intended to help prevent self-harm and other risk behaviours, such as harmful use of alcohol and drugs, that have a negative impact on the mental – and physical – health of young people. WHO has also developed a module on Child and Adolescent Mental and Behavioural Disorders as part of the mhGAP Intervention Guide 2.0. This Guide provides evidence-based clinical protocols for the assessment and management of a range of mental health conditions in non-specialized care settings. Furthermore, WHO is developing and testing scalable psychological interventions to address emotional disorders of adolescents, and guidance on mental health services for adolescents. WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has developed a mental health training package for educators for improved understanding of the importance of mental health in the school setting and to guide the implementation of strategies to promote, protect and restore mental health among their students. It includes training manuals and materials to help scale up the number of schools promoting mental health. (1) 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) [online database].

        "title": "Adolescent pregnancy",
        "content": "Adolescent pregnancy Key facts As of 2019, adolescents aged 15–19 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had an estimated 21 million pregnancies each year, of which approximately 50% were unintended and which resulted in an estimated 12 million births (1,2) . Based on 2019 data, 55% of unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years end in abortions, which are often unsafe in LMICs (1) . Adolescent mothers (aged 10–19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than women aged 20–24 years, and babies of adolescent mothers face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and severe neonatal condition. Data on childbirths among girls aged 10–14 are getting more widely available. Globally the adolescent birth rate for girls 10–14 years in 2023 was estimated at 1.5 per 1000 women with higher rates in sub-Saharan Africa (4.4) and Latin America and the Caribbean (2.3) (3). Preventing pregnancy among adolescents and pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity are foundational to achieving positive health outcomes across the life course and imperative for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to maternal and newborn health. Overview Adolescent pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social and economic consequences. Globally, the adolescent birth rate (ABR) has decreased, but rates of change have been uneven across regions. There are also enormous variations in levels between and within countries. Adolescent pregnancy tends to be higher among those with less education or of low economic status. Further, there is slower progress in reducing adolescent first births amongst these and other vulnerable groups, leading to increasing inequity. Child marriage and child sexual abuse place girls at increased risk of pregnancy, often unintended. In many places, barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding unintended pregnancies. There is growing attention being paid to improving access to quality maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. WHO works with partners to advocate for attention to adolescent pregnancy, to build an evidence base for action, to develop policy and programme support tools, to build capacity and to support countries to address adolescent pregnancy effectively. Scope of the problem Every year, an estimated 21 million girls aged 15–19 years in developing regions become pregnant and approximately 12 million of them give birth (1) . Globally, ABR has decreased from 64.5 births per 1000 women (15–19 years) in 2000 to 41.3 births per 1000 women in 2023. However, rates of change have been uneven in different regions of the world with the sharpest decline in Southern Asia (SA), and slower declines in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions. Although declines have occurred in all regions, SSA and LAC continue have the highest rates globally at 97.9 and 51.4 births per 1000 women, respectively, in 2023 (3). There are enormous differences within regions in ABR as well. In the WHO African Region, the estimated ABR was 97 per 1000 adolescent in 2023 compared to 13.1 per 1000 adolescent girls in the European Region (3). Even within countries, there are enormous variations, for example in Zambia the percentage of adolescent girls aged 15–19 who have begun childbearing (women who either have had a birth or are pregnant at the time of interview) ranged from 14.9% in Lusaka to 42.5% in the Southern Province in 2018 (4). In the Philippines, this ranged from 3.5% in the Cordillera Administrative Region to 17.9% in the Davao Peninsula Region in 2017 (5). While the estimated global ABR has declined, the actual number of childbirths to adolescents continues to be high. The largest number of estimated births to 15–19-year-olds in 2021 occurred in SSA (6 114 000), whereas far fewer births occurred in Central Asia (68 000). The corresponding number was 332 000 among adolescents aged 10–14 years in SSA, compared to 22 000 in South-East Asia (SEA) in the same year (3) . Context in which adolescent pregnancies occur Studies of risk and protective factors related to adolescent pregnancy in LMICs indicate that levels tend to be higher among those with less education or of low economic status (6). Progress in reducing adolescent first births has been particularly slow amongst these vulnerable groups, leading to increasing inequity. Several factors contribute to adolescent pregnancies and births. First, in many societies, girls are under pressure to marry and bear children. As of 2021, the estimated global number of child brides was 650 million : child marriage places girls at increased risk of pregnancy because girls who are married very early typically have limited autonomy to influence decision-making about delaying child-bearing and contraceptive use. Second, in many places, girls choose to become pregnant because they have limited educational and employment prospects and motherhood is valued. Contraceptives are not easily accessible to adolescents in many places. Even when adolescents can obtain contraceptives, they may lack the agency or the resources to pay for them, knowledge on where to obtain them and how to correctly use them. They may face stigma when trying to obtain contraceptives. Further, they are often at higher risk of discontinuing use due to side effects, and due to changing life circumstances and reproductive intentions . Restrictive laws and policies regarding the provision of contraceptives based on age or marital status pose an important barrier to the provision and uptake of contraceptives among adolescents. This is often combined with health worker bias and/or lack of willingness to acknowledge adolescents’ sexual health needs. Child sexual abuse increases the risk of unintended pregnancies. A WHO report published in 2021 estimates that 120 million girls aged under 20 years were subjected to sexual violence by someone other than a partner. This abuse is deeply rooted in gender inequality; it affects more girls than boys, although many boys are also affected . Estimates suggest that in 2020 , at least 1 in 8 of the world’s children had been sexually abused before reaching the age of 18, and 1 in 20 girls aged 15–19 years had experienced forced sex during their lifetime. The WHO report titled Violence against women prevalence estimates 2018 notes that “adolescents aged 15–19 years (24%) are estimated to have already been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner at least once in their lifetime, and 16% of adolescent girls and young women aged 15–19 have been subjected to this violence within the past 12 months.” Preventing adolescent pregnancy and childbearing as well as child marriage is part of the SDG agenda with dedicated indicators, including indicator 3.7.2, “Adolescent birth rate (aged 10–14 years; aged 15–19 years) per 1000 women in that age group,” and 5.3.1, “Proportion of women aged 20–24 years married before the age of 18 years.” Strategies and interventions related to adolescent pregnancy have focused on pregnancy prevention. However, there is growing attention being paid to improving access to and quality of maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. Available data on access paints a mixed picture. Access to quality care depends on the geographic context and the social status of adolescents. Even where access is not limited, adolescents appear to receive a lower quality of both clinical care and interpersonal support than adult women do. WHO response WHO works with partners to advocate for attention to adolescents, build the evidence and epidemiologic base for action, develop and test programme support tools, build capacity, and pilot initiatives in the small but growing number of countries that recognize the need to address adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health. As a result of these collective efforts, adolescent health has moved to the centre of the global health and development agenda. In this evolving context, WHO continues its work across sectors to support countries to address adolescent pregnancy effectively in the context of their national programmes, and to prevent child marriage and provide care and support to married adolescents. Adolescent pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social and economic consequences to individuals, families and communities. There is consensus on the evidence-based actions needed to prevent it. There is growing global, regional and national commitment to preventing child marriage and adolescent pregnancy and childbearing. Nongovernmental organizations have led the effort in several countries. In a growing number of countries, governments are taking the lead to put in place large-scale programmes. They challenge and inspire other countries to do what is doable and urgently needs to be done – now.

        "title": "Causes of adolescent deaths",
        "content": "Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth. This affects how they feel, think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. Despite being thought of as a healthy stage of life, there is significant death, illness and injury in the adolescent years. Much of this is preventable or treatable. During this phase, adolescents establish patterns of behaviour – for instance, related to diet, physical activity, substance use, and sexual activity – that can protect their health and the health of others around them, or put their health at risk now and in the future. To grow and develop in good health, adolescents need information, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; opportunities to develop life skills; health services that are acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective; and safe and supportive environments. They also need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery of interventions to improve and maintain their health. Expanding such opportunities is key to responding to adolescents’ specific needs and rights. There are more adolescents in the world than ever before: 1.3 billion, totalling one sixth of the global population. This number is expected to rise through 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where close to 90% of 10- to 19-year-olds live. An estimated 1.1 million adolescents die each year. The leading causes are road traffic injuries, suicide and interpersonal violence. Millions of adolescents also experience illness and injury. Causes of mortality and morbidity among adolescents differ by sex and age, and also by geographic region. For 10-14-year-olds, the leading risks for health are related to water, hygiene and sanitation. Risks for 15-19-year-olds are more often related to behaviours, such as alcohol use and unsafe sex. Poor diet and low physical activity are additional challenges which begin in childhood and adolescence, as does sexual abuse. Older adolescent girls are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence. Pregnancy complications and unsafe abortions are the leading causes of death among 15-19-year-old girls. Most adolescent mortality and morbidity is preventable or treatable, but adolescents face specific barriers in accessing health information and services. Restrictive laws and policies, parental or partner control, limited knowledge, distance, cost, lack of confidentiality, and provider bias can all restrict adolescents from getting the care they need to grow and develop in good health. WHO supports countries to ensure that their national adolescent health responses are evidence-based and take account of the values and preferences of adolescents. Improving the evidence base on adolescent health is crucial. WHO supports countries to improve measurement and strengthen data, conducts research, and shares best practice. WHO issues evidence-based recommendations that are relevant for – or specific to – adolescents across the full range of health areas including: positive development, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health including HIV, unintentional injury, violence, and mental health, substance abuse and self-harm. To support the implementation of these recommendations, WHO produces a range of policy and programme support tools. At the heart is the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) , which guides national-level policy-makers and programme managers on how to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate adolescent health programmes. WHO also supports countries to scale up efforts in service delivery, financing and governance, helps to build the capacities of national-level researchers and programmers, and provides technical support for policy and programmes.

WHO advocates for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society response anchored on a shared vision for the future of mental health in the Region. Mental health promotion involves actions to strengthen the policy environment and the use of strategic communication for network building, stakeholder engagement, enhanced mental health literacy, and behavior change. Mental health promotion interventions improve overall wellbeing and are delivered in the settings where people live, work, learn, and thrive. These include school and workplace mental health programs, early childhood interventions, social support and community engagement, women empowerment, anti-discrimination programs, and other interventions that address the social determinants of mental health. In order to maximize impact, mental health promotion activities must be linked closely with mental health services, and engage a variety of health and non-health (e.g. education, labour, social welfare, justice, environment, etc.) sectors. WHO also leads high-profile advocacy campaigns to mobilize partners and resources, whilst raising awareness among decision makers and the general public.

        "content": "A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and other conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and wholegrains. Diet can depend on an individual’s food choices, but also the availability and affordability of healthy foods and sociocultural factors. Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment requires involvement across multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government, the public and the private sector. Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to easily adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by policy-makers include: Coordinating trade, food system and agricultural policies with the protection and promotion of public health; Encouraging consumers’ demand for healthy foods and meals; and Promoting healthy nutrition across the life course. The WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was adopted in 2004 by the World Health Assembly. It called on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at global, regional and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity.

        "content": "Overview An estimated 2.3 million newborns die each year. Low- and middle-income countries bear the greatest mortality burden, with sepsis contributing 15%. It is estimated that 84% of newborn deaths due to infection could be averted through early diagnosis and appropriate clinical management. However, diagnostic tests for serious bacterial infection, including bacterial sepsis, among infants are either inadequate or entirely lacking in many settings. The WHO target product profile for in vitro diagnostic tests for serious bacterial infection, including neonatal sepsis, among young infants aims to guide manufacturers, regulators and implementers in developing accessible, affordable tools that improve clinical decision-making, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and save lives, especially in low-resource settings where the burden of neonatal sepsis remains critical. Designed for both hospital and non-hospital settings, the target product profile defines the essential and desirable characteristics of tests to support early, accurate diagnosis among infants aged 0–59 days."

        "content": "WHO calls for action to fight growing HIV epidemic HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are on the rise in the WHO Western Pacific Region, reversing years of progress in the fight against the epidemic. New HIV infections have risen by 8% and AIDS-related deaths by 10% since 2019, highlighting critical gaps in prevention, testing, treatment and care services, particularly for key populations, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While 76% of people living with HIV in the Region have access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART), experts agree that these disturbing trends show that much more needs to be done to stop the spread of HIV and prevent avoidable deaths. Every hour, 16 people are newly infected, and six people die from HIV-related causes in the Western Pacific Region. While other WHO regions have made notable progress in curbing new infections, the Western Pacific Region still faces significant challenges, with 2.3 million people living with HIV, 140 000 new infections and 53 000 deaths in 2023 alone. There are 19 000 children living with HIV in the Region, but only two out of three of them are on ART. Globally in 2023, there were 39.9 million people with HIV; 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes; and another 1.3 million people acquired the virus. Surging new infections The epidemic continues to disproportionately affect key populations, including men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, female sex workers, people who inject drugs and their partners. Between 2010 and 2022, new HIV infections among these groups surged by as much as 85%, highlighting persistent inequities that demand immediate attention. Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, emphasized the urgency of addressing these challenges: “The rising HIV infections and deaths in the Western Pacific Region are a wake-up call. We must urgently address the barriers that prevent people — especially those in key populations and their partners — from accessing prevention, treatment and care.” “Achieving universal health coverage and protecting the right to health are critical to reversing these worrying trends and ensuring that the services are reaching everyone, including the most underserved populations,” he noted. HIV transmission can be prevented. In the Western Pacific Region, domestic funding for HIV response has grown and now surpasses external aid. Effective tools – such as condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and needle and syringe programmes – as well as life-saving treatments such as ART are available. In addition, people taking ART who achieve an undetectable viral load not only prevent the virus from passing to sexual partners, but also can lead long, healthy and productive lives. But these efforts remain underfunded. Inadequate stocks of diagnostics and drugs, along with stigma and discrimination, further hinder progress. Closing these gaps is essential to reduce new infections and ensure equitable access to high-quality prevention and treatment services for all. Illuminating the “right” path Ahead of World AIDS Day on 1 December, WHO calls on governments and communities across the Region to allocate adequate resources to strengthen and sustain HIV services. Integrating HIV prevention, treatment and care within primary health-care systems is critical to improving the accessibility and resilience of these services. This year’s theme – Take the Right Path: My Health, My Right – highlights the critical role of human rights in breaking down barriers to HIV services. Empowering individuals with access to prevention, education and care not only improves their health, but also upholds their fundamental rights. Ensuring equal access is essential for stopping new infections and enabling people living with HIV to lead long, healthy and fulfilling lives. ______________________________________ For more information, please contact: WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific Communications Unit Email: wprocom@who.int Related HIV/AIDS in the Western Pacific World AIDS Day 2024 Feature stories"

        "title": "WHO urges governments to stop subsidizing life-threatening tobacco crops",
        "content": "WHO urges governments to stop subsidizing life-threatening tobacco crops MANILA – To mark World No Tobacco Day on 31 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) urges governments to stop subsidizing tobacco farming and support more sustainable crops that could feed millions. “Tobacco is used by more than 400 million people in the Western Pacific Region, and every year, 3 million of them are killed by this deadly product,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Acting Regional Director for the Western Pacific. “When governments continue to prioritize business over health, ecosystems will be lost; people will go hungry; and health will decline.” Millions of people in the Western Pacific face food insecurity. Meanwhile, more than 1 million hectares of land in the Region are used to grow tobacco. If this land were used to grow food instead, about 60 000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables could be grown, providing the recommended daily intake for more than 400 000 people a year. Or roughly 243 000 tonnes of rice could be produced, which would feed more than 3 million people a year. Seven of the world’s top 50 tobacco growing countries are located in the Region: Cambodia, China, Japan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. Tobacco farming exposes farmers and their families to toxic tobacco dust and chemical pesticides. Additionally, the environment suffers due to deforestation, contamination of water sources and degradation of soil. A new WHO report entitled “Grow food, not tobacco” highlights the ills of tobacco growing and the benefits of switching to more sustainable food crops for farmers, communities, economies, the environment and the world at large. The report also exposes how the tobacco industry traps farmers in a vicious cycle of debt, propagating tobacco growing by exaggerating its economic benefits and lobbying through farming front groups. Tobacco farming causes diseases to the farmers and more than 1 million child laborers around the world estimated to be working on tobacco farms and missing out on education. “Imagine if we used the same 1 million hectares to grow nutritious food. We could nourish millions of people, help children grow and develop, and support adults to reach their full potential,” said Dr Jakab. “It’s time to grow food, not tobacco.” Tobacco growing is a global problem. Trees cut down for tobacco farming make up 5% of global deforestation – an area roughly the size of Samoa disappears every year. Experiences from countries in the Region such as Cambodia, Malaysia and the Philippines, have demonstrated that tobacco growers can shift from tobacco to economically viable alternative crops — such as vegetables, peanuts and mung beans—with appropriate government support and interventions. Today, all Western Pacific countries are parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). They are committed to “promote economically “promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers and growers.” alternatives for tobacco workers and growers.” Ending subsidies for tobacco growing and supporting healthier crops would help countries fulfil that commitment. By choosing to grow food instead of tobacco, countries can prioritize health, preserve ecosystems and increase food security. Every year on World No Tobacco Day, people and institutions are honoured for making a difference in tobacco control. This year, five awardees in the Western Pacific Region are being recognized for exceptional contributions to tobacco control: The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of Cambodia; The Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Revenue and Customs Services, and the Police Force of Fiji; The Cultural and Social Committee of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic; Senator Pilar Juliana “Pia” Schramm Cayetano of the Philippines; and the Ministry of Health of Vanuatu.

        "content": "WHO turns 75: People live 30 years longer, but more action needed to ensure health for all and prepare for future threats Emergencies, climate change and noncommunicable diseases loom as threats to health. MANILA – Public health achievements over the past 75 years have extended life for people in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region by at least three decades. Yet too many are left behind, and looming threats still challenge decades of health gains, says WHO on its 75 th anniversary. When WHO was created after the Second World War, people in the countries and areas of the Western Pacific had a life expectancy of between 40 and 50 years. In some parts of the Region, up to half of the infants born never saw their first birthday. Care in many places was limited to emergency treatment, as there were too few health workers – an issue that persists until today in some parts of the Region. In 1948, smallpox and polio were major threats. Malaria was widespread. And neglected tropical diseases, such as yaws, were important public health problems. Hunger, nutritional deficiencies and poor access to safe water and sanitation further harmed people’s health and their potential as individuals, communities and societies. Extending healthy life in the Western Pacific Today, the people of the Western Pacific live for 77 years on average, thanks to public health investments and innovations. “For 75 years, WHO has been working hand-in-hand with countries and partners to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable, so all people can attain the highest level of health and well-being,” says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Acting Regional Director for the Western Pacific. “Now is the time to celebrate past achievements, build upon them and do more to extend the quality of people’s lives across the Western Pacific.” Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and the Region has been free of wild poliovirus transmission since 2000. Over the past two decades, malaria deaths in the Western Pacific have decreased by 88%. Several countries have eliminated or nearly eliminated the disease, as well as others including rubella (a virus that causes birth defects when pregnant women are infected), lymphatic filariasis (a disease caused by parasitic worms, commonly known as elephantiasis) and trachoma (an infection that causes blindness). Across the Region, advances in the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene have contributed to a 60% reduction since 2000 in deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases. Primary health care has brought many services closer to communities. Today in the Region, more mothers and children are surviving and thriving. Nearly all births are supported by skilled health professionals, and life-saving vaccinations now reach 90% of children. Breastfeeding is also better protected and supported, with 15 countries in the Region having laws based on The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes . Over the past four decades, as the burden in the Region of some infectious diseases eased while the impact of chronic diseases grew, WHO has increased health promotion efforts to protect people from harmful risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. In Pacific island countries and areas, adoption of the Yanuca Island Declaration in 1995 resulted in the Healthy Islands vision to promote and protect health across sectors. This vision has helped shape the approach to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by supporting a focus on the environments in which people are nurtured, work and play. The world’s first public health treaty was the 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Today, countries and areas across the Western Pacific have implemented FCTC measures to protect present and future generations from the devastating impacts of tobacco use. In 2011, Australia became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging, paving the way for other countries to take more aggressive steps to regulate the promotion of tobacco products. From outbreaks of cholera and avian flu to SARS and COVID-19, WHO has supported countries to prepare for and respond to major health emergencies. In 2003 in the Western Pacific, SARS became the first international outbreak in which information about a new disease was gathered and made public in real time. This information improved the ability of WHO, countries and partners to quickly move people, resources and supplies to where they were needed most. Lessons from outbreaks have been identified and utilized to continuously strengthen health security in this Region, including three iterations of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies . When COVID-19 emerged, WHO supported countries and areas to respond quickly and strategically. These efforts have contributed to relatively low mortality rates and high vaccination coverage in the Region, particularly among health workers and other vulnerable populations. More to do to achieve health for all The WHO Constitution says “the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being, without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.” Despite great progress over the past three quarters of a century, the goal of “health for all” remains elusive. Life expectancies in some countries in the Region are still a decade shorter than the regional average. And too many people still lack access to good-quality health services without financial burden. “We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable among us—leaving no one behind in the march towards better health and development.” Dr Jakab explains. “And we owe it to future generations whom the Organization will serve over the next 75 years to ensure they have equal opportunities for living long, healthy lives. “WHO – the only organization with this unique mandate, footprint and expertise – will continue to accelerate action to achieve health for all. It will take new ways of thinking and working, sustained funding and commitment from governments and a wide range of partners working alongside us to meet today’s health challenges and opportunities, and more in the future,” she adds. To protect all people in the Region from present and future threats and deliver on the promise of health for all, WHO and Member States are working together to build resilient health systems for universal health coverage, based upon a primary health-care approach. They are focusing on four thematic priorities, as outlined in the For the Future vision to make the Western Pacific the world’s safest and healthiest region: Health security and antimicrobial resistance The increasing rate of health emergencies, the emergence of new pathogens and the spread of antimicrobial resistance are threatening health security in the Region. In 2022 alone, WHO responded to 19 such threats in the Region, including mpox and human cases of avian flu. WHO is working with Member States to prepare for future pandemics, health emergencies and outbreaks, and to build resilient health systems that respond effectively to epidemics and prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections. The increasing rate of health emergencies, the emergence of new pathogens and the spread of antimicrobial resistance are threatening health security in the Region. WHO is working with Member States to prepare for future pandemics, health emergencies and outbreaks, and to build resilient health systems that respond effectively to epidemics and prevent the spread of drug-resistant infections. Noncommunicable diseases and ageing Changing consumption patterns, lifestyles and rapid urbanization have led to an increase in NCDs such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. Almost nine out of 10 deaths in the Region today are due to NCDs. The Region also has one of the largest and fastest growing older populations in the world, increasing the demand for primary health care and long-term care. Recognizing that people’s health is largely determined by their social and physical environment, WHO is working across sectors to advocate for heathy societies, which help to reduce risk factors that lead to NCDs, improve mental health and reorient systems to support all people to live long, healthy and productive lives.

Climate change, the environment and health Climate change and environmental hazards such as air pollution, exposure to hazardous chemicals, and lack of water and sanitation pose serious threats to people’s health. At the same time, rising sea levels and extreme weather events associated with climate change can damage infrastructure and disrupt the delivery of health services, posing additional health and safety risks. WHO is supporting countries to monitor the health impacts of climate change and the environment—from warmer temperatures that increase vector-borne diseases to extreme weather that triggers more waterborne and foodborne diseases—and strengthen health sector resilience to withstand climate shocks. WHO is working across sectors to shape policies to protect the health of the planet and its people. Climate change and environmental hazards such as air pollution, exposure to hazardous chemicals, and lack of water and sanitation pose serious threats to people’s health. WHO is working across sectors to shape policies to protect the health of the planet and its people. Reaching the unreached In many countries, some groups—such as the poor, ethnic minorities or those in remote areas—still suffer from high rates of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis, and too many mothers and infants are still lost during pregnancy and birth. Vaccine coverage among some groups remains stubbornly low, leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases and needless death and disability. Health is still not for all, when the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups are left behind. WHO is working with Member States and partners in the Region to find new approaches, build on public health innovations to achieve equitable access to affordable, good-quality services, and deliver on the promise of universal health coverage—with strong primary health care and human resources at its base—for everyone, everywhere. Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal opportunity for a safe and healthy life. We are the United Nations agency for health, leading the global response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. Through its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, its six regional offices and 150 country offices, WHO works to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. The Western Pacific Regional Office is in Manila, Philippines. The Region is home to more than 1.9 billion people across 37 countries and areas: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Fiji, France (which has responsibility for French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna), Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Kiribati, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Macao SAR (China), Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Mongolia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (which has responsibility for the Pitcairn Islands), the United States of America (which has responsibility for American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam), Vanuatu and Viet Nam. For the Future is the vision for WHO’s work with Member States and partners in the Western Pacific. It sets out the thematic priorities for the Organization’s work in the Region, as well as a series of ideas and approaches for collectively responding to current and future health challenges.

Rates of abuse of older people are high in institutions such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities, with 2 in 3 staff reporting that they have committed abuse in the past year. Rates of abuse of older people have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abuse of older people can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Abuse of older people is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations. The global population of people aged 60 years and older will more than double, from 900 million in 2015 to about 2 billion in 2050. Overview The abuse of older people, also known as elder abuse, is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect. Scope of the problem Abuse of older people is an important public health problem. A 2017 review of 52 studies in 28 countries from diverse regions estimated that over the past year 1 in 6 people (15.7%) aged 60 years and older were subjected to some form of abuse (1) . Although rigorous data are limited, the review provides prevalence estimates of the proportion of older people affected by different types of abuse (see Table 1). Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. However, a review of recent studies on abuse of older people in institutional settings (2) indicates that 64.2% of staff reported perpetrating some form of abuse in the past year. Table 1: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses Abuse of older people in community settings (1) Abuse of older people in institutional settings (2) Type of abuse Reported by older adults Reported by older adults and their proxies Reported by staff Overall prevalence 15.7% Not enough data 64.2% or 2 in 3 staff Psychological abuse: 11.6% 33.4% 32.5% Physical abuse: 2.6% 14.1% 9.3% Financial abuse: 6.8% 13.8% Not enough data Neglect: 4.2% 11.6% 12.0% Sexual abuse: 0.9% 1.9% 0.7% Emerging evidence indicates that the prevalence of abuse of older people in both the community and in institutions have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. A US study, for instance, suggests that rates in the community may have increased by as much as 84% (3) . Abuse of older people in community settings Abuse of older people in institutional settings Globally, the number of cases of elder abuse is projected to increase as many countries have rapidly ageing populations. Even if the proportion of victims of abuse of older people remains constant, the global number of victims will increase rapidly due to population ageing, growing to some 320 million victims by 2050, as the global population of people aged 60 years and more increases to 2 billion by 2050. Consequences Abuse of older people can have serious physical and mental health, financial, and social consequences, including, for instance, physical injuries, premature mortality, depression, cognitive decline, financial devastation and placement in nursing homes. For older people, the consequences of abuse can be especially serious and recovery may take longer (4) . Risk factors Individual level characteristics which increase the risk of becoming a victim of abuse include functional dependence/disability, poor physical health, cognitive impairment, poor mental health and low income. Individual level characteristics which increase the risk of becoming a perpetrator of abuse include mental illness, substance abuse and dependency – often financial – of the abuser on the victim. At the relationship level, the type of relationship (e.g., spouse/partner or child/parent) and marital status may be associated with an elevated risk of abuse, but these factors vary by country and region. Community- and societal-level factors linked to elder abuse may include ageism against older people and certain cultural norms (e.g., normalization of violence). Social support and living alone reduce the likelihood of elder abuse (5) . Prevention Many strategies have been tried to prevent and respond to abuse of older people, but evidence for the effectiveness of most of these interventions is limited at present. Strategies considered most promising include caregiver interventions, which provide services to relieve the burden of caregiving; money management programmes for older adults vulnerable to financial exploitation; helplines and emergency shelters; and multi-disciplinary teams, as the responses required often cut across many systems, including criminal justice, health care, mental health care, adults protective services and long-term care ( 5 ). In some countries, the health sector has taken a leading role in raising public concern about abuse of older people, while in others the social welfare sector has taken the lead. Globally, too little is known about elder abuse and how to prevent it, particularly in developing countries. WHO response On 15 June 2022, World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, WHO and partners published “ Tackling abuse of older people: five priorities for the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) ”. These five priorities, arrived at through wide consultation, are: Combat ageism as it is a major reason why the abuse of older people receives so little attention. Generate more and better data to raise awareness of the problem. Develop and scale up cost–effective solutions to stop abuse of older people. Make an investment case focusing on how addressing the problem is money well spent. Raise funds as more resources are needed to tackle the problem.

        "content": "Mental health of older adults Key facts By 2030, one in six people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. Loneliness and social isolation are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life. One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers. Approximately 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder. Mental disorders among older adults account for 10.6% of the total years lived with disability for this age group. Overview The world’s population is ageing fast. In 2020, 1 billion people in the world were aged 60 years or over. That figure will rise to 1.4 billion by 2030, representing one in six people globally. By 2050, the number of people aged 60 years and over will have doubled to reach 2.1 billion. The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million (1) . Older adults contribute to society as family and community members, and many are volunteers and workers. While most have good health, many are at risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Many may also experience reduced mobility, chronic pain, frailty, dementia or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term care. As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time. Prevalence Around 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder (2) . According to the Global Health Estimates (GHE) 2019 , these conditions account for 10.6% of the total disability (in disability adjusted life years, DALYs) among older adults. The most common mental health conditions for older adults are depression and anxiety. GHE 2019 shows that globally, around a quarter of deaths from suicide (27.2%) are among people aged 60 or over. Mental health conditions among older people are often underrecognized and undertreated, and the stigma surrounding these conditions can make people reluctant to seek help. Risk factors At older ages, mental health is shaped not only by physical and social environments but also by the cumulative impacts of earlier life experiences and specific stressors related to ageing. Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress. Older adults are more likely to experience adverse events such as bereavement, or a drop in income or reduced sense of purpose with retirement. Despite their many contributions to society, many older adults are subject to ageism , which can seriously affect people’s mental health. Social isolation and loneliness , which affect about a quarter of older people, are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life (3) . So too is abuse of older people , which includes any kind of physical, verbal, psychological, sexual or financial abuse, as well as neglect. One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers (4) . Abuse of older adults has serious consequences and can lead to depression and anxiety. Many older people are carers of spouses with chronic health conditions, such as dementia . The responsibilities of such care can be overwhelming and can affect the carer’s mental health. Some older adults are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, because of dire living conditions, poor physical health or lack of access to quality support and services. This includes older adults living in humanitarian settings and those living with chronic illnesses (such as heart disease, cancer or stroke), neurological conditions (such as dementia), or substance use problems. Promotion and prevention Mental health promotion and prevention strategies for older adults focus on supporting healthy ageing . That means creating physical and social environments that support well-being and enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. Key mental health promotion and prevention strategies for healthy ageing include: measures to reduce financial insecurity and income inequality; programmes to ensure safe and accessible housing, public buildings and transport; social support for older adults and their carers; support for healthy behaviours, especially to eat a balanced diet, be physically active, refrain from tobacco and reduce alcohol use; and health and social programmes targeted at vulnerable groups such as those who live alone or in remote areas and those living with a chronic health condition. For older adults, social connection is particularly important to reduce risk factors such as social isolation and loneliness. At this stage of life, meaningful social activities can significantly improve positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life; they can also reduce depressive symptoms. Example interventions include befriending initiatives, community and support groups, social skills training, creative arts groups, leisure and education services and volunteering programmes. Protection from ageism and abuse is also critical. Key interventions include anti-discrimination policies and laws, educational interventions and intergenerational activities. A range of carer interventions – including respite care, advice, education, financial support and psychological interventions – can support carers to maintain a good and healthy caring relationship that avoids abuse of older people. Treatment and care Prompt recognition and treatment of mental health conditions (and associated neurological and substance use conditions) in older adults is essential. This should follow standards for integrated care for older people , which is community-based and focused on both the long-term care of older adults living with mental health conditions and declines in intrinsic capacity, as well as the education, training and support of carers. A mix of mental health interventions are usually recommended, alongside other supports to address the health, personal care and social needs of individuals. Dementia is often an important concern. It affects people’s mental health (for example, sparking symptoms of psychosis and depression), and requires access to quality mental health care. Responding to the abuse of older adults is also critical. Promising interventions include mandatory reporting of abuse, self-help groups, helplines and emergency shelters, psychological programmes for abusers, training of health care providers and other caregiver support interventions. WHO response WHO works with diverse partners on strategies, programmes and tools to support governments respond to the mental health needs of older adults. For example, the Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) is a global collaboration led by WHO to improve the lives of older people, their families and the communities in which they live. WHO Member States have also endorsed the Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 , which supports improved mental health and mental health care for all populations, including older adults. WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) provides evidence-based clinical protocols for assessing, managing and following up a set of priority mental, neurological and substance use conditions in non-specialized settings, including depression and dementia. The mhGAP intervention guide includes clinical tips for working with older adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO and partners in the Inter-Agency-Standing Committee (IASC) developed the Living with the times toolkit of illustrated posters to help older adults maintain good mental health and well-being. Other WHO activities to support the mental health of older adults include the development of scalable psychological interventions to address depression and anxiety, research and guidance on interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness, and cost–effective solutions to prevent abuse of older adults.

        "title": "Dementia",
        "content": "Dementia Key facts In 2021, 57 million people had dementia worldwide, over 60% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases. Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies globally US$ 1.3 trillion, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day. Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly. Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also provide 70% of care hours for people living with dementia. Overview Dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. The illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age. Things that increase the risk of developing dementia include: age (more common in those 65 or older) high blood pressure (hypertension) high blood sugar (diabetes) being overweight or obese smoking drinking too much alcohol being physically inactive being socially isolated depression. Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care. Signs and symptoms Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities. Early signs and symptoms are: forgetting things or recent events losing or misplacing things getting lost when walking or driving being confused, even in familiar places losing track of time difficulties solving problems or making decisions problems following conversations or trouble finding words difficulties performing familiar tasks misjudging distances to objects visually. Common changes in mood and behaviour include: feeling anxious, sad, or angry about memory loss personality changes inappropriate behaviour withdrawal from work or social activities being less interested in other people’s emotions. Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the person’s cognitive functioning before becoming ill. Most symptoms become worse over time, while others might disappear or only occur in the later stages of dementia. As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowls, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them. Common forms of dementia Dementia is caused by many different diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly damage the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist. Treatment and care There is no cure for dementia, but a lot can be done to support both people living with the illness and those who care for them. People with dementia can take steps to maintain their quality of life and promote their well-being by: being physically active taking part in activities and social interactions that stimulate the brain and maintain daily function. In addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms: Cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are used to treat Alzheimer disease. NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine are used for severe Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent additional damage to the brain due to vascular dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with severe symptoms of depression in people living with dementia if lifestyle and social changes don’t work, but these should not be the first option. If people living with dementia are at risk of hurting themselves or others, medicines like haloperidol and risperidone can help, but these should never be used as the first treatment Self-care For those diagnosed with dementia, there are things that can help manage symptoms: Stay physically active. Eat healthily. Stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Get regular check-ups with your doctor. Write down everyday tasks and appointments to help you remember important things. Keep up your hobbies and do things that you enjoy. Try new ways to keep your mind active. Spend time with friends and family and engage in community life. Plan ahead of time. Over time, it may be harder to make important decisions for yourself or your finances: Identify people you trust to support you in making decisions and help you communicate your choices. Create an advance plan to tell people what your choices and preferences are for care and support. Bring your ID with your address and emergency contacts when leaving the house. Reach out to family and friends for help. Talk to people you know about how they can help you. Join a local support group. It is important to recognize that providing care and support for a person living with dementia can be challenging, impacting the carer’s own health and well-being. As someone supporting a person living with dementia, reach out to family members, friends, and professionals for help. Take regular breaks and look after yourself. Try stress management techniques such as mindfulness-based exercises and seek professional help and guidance if needed. Risk factors and prevention Although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not an inevitable consequence of biological ageing. Further, dementia does not exclusively affect older people – young onset dementia (defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases. Studies show that people can reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia by being physically active , not smoking, avoiding harmful use of alcohol , controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Additional risk factors include depression, social isolation, low educational attainment, cognitive inactivity and air pollution . Human rights Unfortunately, people living with dementia are frequently denied the basic rights and freedoms available to others. In many countries, physical and chemical restraints are used extensively in care homes for older people and in acute-care settings, even when regulations are in place to uphold the rights of people to freedom and choice. An appropriate and supportive legislative environment based on internationally-accepted human rights standards is required to ensure the highest quality of care for people with dementia and their carers. WHO response WHO recognizes dementia as a public health priority. In May 2017, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017-2025 . The Plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for action – for policy-makers, international, regional and national partners, and WHO in the following areas: addressing dementia as a public health priority; increasing awareness of dementia and creating a dementia-inclusive society; reducing the risk of dementia; diagnosis, treatment and care; information systems for dementia; support for dementia carers; and, research and innovation To facilitate the monitoring of the global dementia action plan, WHO developed the Global Dementia Observatory (GDO), a data portal that collates country data on 35 key dementia indicators across the global action plan’s seven strategic areas. As a complement to the GDO, WHO launched the GDO Knowledge Exchange Platform , which is a repository of good practices examples in the area of dementia with the goal of fostering mutual learning and multi-directional exchange between regions, countries and individuals to facilitate action globally.

        "title": "Assistive technology",
        "content": "Assistive technology Key facts Assistive products can range from physical products such as wheelchairs, glasses, prosthetic limbs, white canes, and hearing aids to digital solutions such as speech recognition or time management software and captioning. Most people who use assistive technology use more than one product, making integrated services important. Globally, more than 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products. With an ageing global population and a rise in noncommunicable diseases, an estimated 3.5 billion people will need assistive technology by 2050. In many countries, most people who need assistive technology do not have access to it. Overview Assistive technology is an umbrella term for assistive products and their related systems and services. Assistive products help maintain or improve an individual’s functioning related to cognition, communication, hearing, mobility, self-care and vision, thus enabling their health, well-being, inclusion and participation. Improving access to assistive technology can contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and to ensuring that no one is left behind. This is through enabling the inclusion and participation of assistive technology users in their family, community and all areas of society, including the political, economic and social spheres. Who can benefit from assistive technology? Most people will need assistive technology at some point in their lives, especially as they age. While some may require assistive technology temporarily, such as after an accident or illness, others may require it for a longer period or throughout their lifespan. Assistive technology is most needed by: older people children and adults with disabilities people with long term health conditions such as diabetes, stroke and dementia. Benefits of assistive technology Assistive technology can help people in all aspects of their lives, including in education, employment, fitness, leisure and other everyday activities such as self-care, cooking and reading. Assistive technology can positively impact a person, their family and friends, and has broader socioeconomic benefits. For example: early provision of hearing aids for young children supports their development of language and communication skills, limiting negative impacts on their education, future employment and community participation; provision of appropriate wheelchairs facilitates mobility, improving individuals’ access to education and employment while reducing healthcare costs due to a reduction in secondary complications such as pressure sores and contractures; therapeutic footwear for diabetes reduces the incidence of foot ulcers, preventing amputations and the associated impact on individuals and burden on health-care systems; and timely provision of assistive technology for older people can improve their independence and safety as well as enable them to live at home for as long as possible. Unmet global need The WHO and UNICEF Global report on assistive technology (2022) demonstrates considerable inequity in access to assistive technology. As few as 3% of people in some low-income countries were reported to have access to the assistive products they need, in comparison to 90% in some high-income countries. Examples of the unmet global need for specific assistive technology include: mobility: of the 80 million people who need a wheelchair, only 5­–35% have access to one , depending on the country in which they live; and hearing: globally, 1.5 billion people have hearing loss, yet hearing aid production currently meets less than 10% of the global demand. Unaddressed hearing loss across the globe leads to an annual cost of US$ 980 billion . Barriers impacting access to assistive technology include low awareness, high costs, limited physical access, inadequate product range, procurement challenges, workforce capacity gaps, inadequate policy, insufficient funding, assistive technology sector fragmentation and sociodemographic obstacles. Assistive technology within universal health coverage The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development places good health and well-being at the centre of a new development vision. It emphasizes universal health coverage (UHC) to ensure sustainable development for all so that everyone can access the health services needed without financial hardship. Addressing the unmet need for assistive products is crucial for achieving Sustainable Development Goals, providing UHC, and implementing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ‘Leaving no one behind’ means ensuring people with disabilities, the older population, those affected by chronic diseases and everyone who needs assistive technology are included in society and able to live healthy and dignified lives. What needs to be done? The WHO and UNICEF Global report on assistive technology (2022) offers recommendations specifically intended to steer governments and other stakeholders towards achieving universal access to assistive technology. These 10 priority recommendations underline the ongoing efforts required to enhance access to assistive technology for all in need. Improve access to assistive technology within all development sectors. Ensure safe, effective and affordable assistive products. Enhance workforce capacity. Involve users and families in the entire assistive technology access pathway. Raise public awareness and combat stigma regarding assistive technology. Invest in data-driven policy. Foster research and innovation. Develop enabling environments that benefit everyone involved in assistive technology. Include assistive technology in humanitarian responses. Strengthen international cooperation on assistive technology. WHO response WHO is taking measures to address the global disparity in access to assistive technology, developing normative guidance and providing technical support to Member States to support them in implementing the 2018 World Health Assembly Resolution on Improving Access to Assistive Technology (WHA71.8). WHO uses the WHO-GATE 5P framework as a strategy for strengthening access to assistive technology in any context. This strategy places people at the centre and focuses equal attention on policy, products, provision and personnel as interconnected elements that must be aligned to ensure equitable access. WHO and UNICEF published the Global Report on Assistive Technology in 2022 , which provides the most comprehensive global evidence on assistive technology. WHO has developed a range of guidance, tools and resources in collaboration with other partners to support countries to strengthen their assistive technology provision systems. WHO is also the Secretariat for the Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology (GATE) Initiative , which brings together diverse stakeholders who share the vision of a world where assistive technology is universally accessible to everyone, everywhere.

        "content": "Universal health coverage (UHC) means all people and communities have access to quality health services when and where they need them, without suffering financial hardship. In 2015, at the Sixty-sixth session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, Member States adopted a resolution on UHC and endorsed “Universal Health Coverage: Moving Towards Better Health” — an action framework that provides guidance for Member States to accelerate progress towards UHC and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The action framework recognizes that countries are on different pathways towards UHC and identifies five interrelated attributes of high-performing health systems: quality, efficiency, equity, accountability, sustainability, and resilience. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports the Member States to advance towards UHC by facilitating high-level multisectoral policy dialogues, providing strategic advice and technical assistance, strengthening country capacity, engaging with development partners to support national planning processes and ensure donor funding alignment with national health priorities, as well as providing a regional platform to review progress, identify priorities, and explore solutions to accelerate progress.

        "title": "Taking action on the social determinants of health",
        "content": "The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and also includes the health system. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Social determinants of health are often responsible for health inequities – the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Beyond the immediate health outcomes, these health inequities have broader societal implications, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for educational and economic advancement. Addressing health inequities and their social determinants of health in the Western Pacific Region is not only a matter of public health but also a crucial step toward fostering a more just and inclusive society, with potential long-term benefits for both individuals, their families and society at large. WHO in the Western Pacific supports Member States in taking action on their social determinants of health by: Building capacity at national and local level to measure health inequities and their social determinants within and across countries and establishing regional and national monitoring systems. Designing and implementing strategies and programmes to address health inequities and their social determinants. Building investment cases for action on the social determinants of health. Calculating the economic footprint of the health system, including in deprived areas. Working to meaningful engage with diverse and representative communities and sectors for health. Fostering and facilitating knowledge exchange among Member States and relevant stakeholders on best practices for intersectoral action on how to identify and address health inequities.

        "content": "Connecting care across generations: WHO visits Penang As part of a continued series of visits to Malaysian States, the WHO team visited Penang to meet healthcare professionals and government representatives to learn from successful local health practices and understand challenges faced by the State. During this mission, WHO engaged with Penang’s health authorities, civil society and community leaders to explore how the State is advancing integrated healthcare and championing age-friendly initiatives. From digital health gaps and chronic disease management to wellness hubs and active ageing centres, the visit underscored both the challenges being addressed and the innovations shaping Penang’s journey toward a more inclusive, people-centred health system. WHO visits PAWE Jelutong in Penang, where older adults stay active, connected and engaged through community-led support Credit: WHO/Rohini Rajadorai “Healthy ageing is not just about health services—it’s about community, independence and inclusivity of the elderly,” said Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. The mission strengthened collaboration with Penang’s health authorities and civil society partners, highlighted innovative local solutions and potential support needed for the State's ongoing journey toward becoming a model for Age-Friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) in Malaysia and beyond. Ageing in action: Community at the core With one of the highest rates of ageing in the country, Penang is one of the few Malaysian States formally engaged in the WHO AFCC Global Network. During a high-level dialogue, WHO met with YB Daniel Gooi Zi Sen, Executive Councillor (EXCO) for Youth, Sports and Health and YB Lim Siew Kim, Executive Councillor (EXCO) for Social Development and Welfare, both reaffirmed their support for public health and healthy ageing strategies. WHO met with Penang EXCOs to discuss healthy ageing and inclusive health systems under the AFCC framework The State Health Department, led by Penang State Health Director Dr Fazilah Shaik Allaudin also shared ongoing initiatives and aspirations to build environments that enable people to age well—from health facilities to public spaces. Insightful discussions with the Penang State Health team The visit to Pusat Aktiviti Warga Emas (PAWE) Jelutong, a Senior Citizen Activity Centre, offered a powerful example of healthy ageing in action. Run in collaboration with the Penang Island City Council (MBPP), Rose Charities and the Penang Women’s Development Corporation, the centre supports older adults in staying active, connected and engaged. PAWE Jelutong exemplifies ageing in action—where older adults stay connected and engaged through care, purpose and community “This is our second home. We’re not just passing time—we’re learning, moving and making new friends,” shared a regular visitor at PAWE. Care for all stages of life At health facilities like the Jalan Perak Health Complex, Kepala Batas Hospital and the Sg Burung Community Clinic, the WHO team observed services supporting older adults through rehabilitation, chronic disease management and antenatal care. In Seberang Perai Utara, the team visited a Wellness Hub run by the Health Promotion Branch, offering preventive services like smoking cessation, nutrition counselling and creative arts therapy. One flagship programme—I-Fit-and-Eat-Right (IFitEr)—helps adults manage weight through structured behaviour change and lifestyle modification. Some 56.5% of adults in Penang are overweight or obese, this rate exceeds the already worrying national average, which makes such programmes important. Community members take part in structured lifestyle programmes at the Wellness Hub, supporting healthier living through fitness, nutrition and behavioural change Such initiatives not only prevent and delay decline in older age but promote autonomy and improve quality of life. The mission concluded with a meeting with the Penang Family Health Development Association a civil society partner delivering HIV and sexual and reproductive health services. Their inclusive approach—serving both citizens and non-citizens—highlights the importance of universal access across age, identity and background. Health check-ups that promote healthy ageing and community well-being As Malaysia’s population ages, Penang is demonstrating what it means to grow older with dignity, support and purpose in an inclusive environment. Through strong partnerships, innovative community programmes and a clear commitment to inclusion, the State is paving the way for more age-friendly health systems and environments. WHO looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Penang to share lessons, support local solutions and help ensure that everyone—at every stage of life—can live and age well. The visits to States helps WHO Country office to provide more responsive, evidence-informed technical support to the Ministry of Health."

        "content": "Region’s health ministers endorse action to promote access to vaccines, safe surgery and healthy ageing Health ministers across the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region endorsed action plans to improve access to life-saving vaccines and safe and affordable surgery and to promote healthy ageing. The resolutions were adopted on the final day of the seventy-first session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific, which was held virtually this week. Protecting all with immunization Delegates today endorsed the Regional Strategic Framework for Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization in the Western Pacific (2021–2030) . It calls on Member States to further strengthen and expand immunization systems and programmes along the life course, strategically manage health intelligence on vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, and ensure preparedness for and response to public health emergencies related to vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccines and immunization programmes. Countries and areas of the Region have achieved many successes in eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases, such as maintaining polio-free status over the Region since 2000, eliminating measles in nine countries and rubella in five countries in 2019, and reducing chronic hepatitis B infection among children. However, many people are still being missed by immunization efforts, leading to the emergence, resurgence and large-scale outbreaks over the past two years of vaccine-preventable diseases such as vaccine-derived poliovirus, measles and diphtheria in high-risk communities within the Region. While more vaccines are now available for various age groups such as adolescents, adults and older people and against various diseases such as cervical cancer, pneumococcal disease and seasonal flu, the expansion of immunization service delivery throughout the life course has not yet occurred in many countries. Moreover, immunization systems and programmes are still not resilient enough to withstand major public health emergencies. The Framework adopted today sets out 18 strategies to expand the scope of immunization, maximize the benefits of vaccines and immunization programmes in the Region, and achieve and sustain elimination of additional vaccine-preventable diseases beyond those traditionally targeted, aiming to make the Region free from vaccine-preventable morbidity, mortality and disability towards 2030. Safe and affordable surgery Delegates endorsed the Action Framework for Safe and Affordable Surgery in the Western Pacific Region (2021–2030) . It calls for the development of well-functioning “surgical ecosystems” to solve service delivery problems and achieve universal access to safe and affordable surgery. Surgical care saves lives and improves the quality of life of millions of people every year. Most people will require surgical care at some point in their lives, for a disease or condition such as complications of obstructed labour, a birth defect, cataracts, cancer, heart disease, stroke, complications of diabetes, and burns or injuries from domestic, industrial or road accidents. But access to safe and affordable surgery remains limited in the Region. Geographical challenges can make it hard for people on far-flung islands and other remote areas to access advanced care. It remains unaffordable for many in places where patients need to pay out of pocket. There are challenges for patient safety due to the complexity of care and the risk of infection. Historically, it has been less prominent in the long-term health plans of countries and opportunities have been missed to build up surgical ecosystems – networks of skilled health workers, processes, equipment and other material necessary for delivering quality surgical care. The Framework adopted today guides countries through a process of bringing together stakeholders to generate a shared vision, collaborate on evidence-based action, redesign existing systems, and strengthen information to measure progress and inform further action. Healthy ageing Delegates endorsed the Regional Actional Plan on Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific. It calls for the transformation of societies and health systems to promote healthy ageing. More than 240 million people aged 65 years and over live in the Western Pacific Region, and this number is expected to double by 2050. Changing population demographics have significant health, social and economic implications such as a shift in disease burden towards noncommunicable diseases and a growing population with more diverse health and social needs. But challenges can turn into opportunities when societies become more age-friendly. People who live longer and healthier can engage in activities over their whole lifetime. A growing older population that is better educated and healthier can contribute more, through doing paid and unpaid work, consuming and investing, passing down knowledge and traditions, and acting as caregivers for young family members. The Regional Action Plan adopted today outlines actions for countries to transform health and social systems so that people stay healthy throughout their lives and participate in society. It also encourages countries to change the discourse on ageing to one that recognizes the many valuable contributions that older people can make to society when they are supported to do so. Closure of session The seventy-first session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific concluded today.

        "content": "Samoa: promoting COVID-19 prevention among vulnerable populations At the time of writing, Samoa is free of COVID-19. Preventative and precautionary measures were implemented early and continue. WHO has played a strong role in keeping COVID-19 at bay in Samoa by supporting a mass media campaign, training clinical teams on prevention, screening, testing as well as carrying out isolation, case management and intensifying mental health services. WHO's COVID-19 support to Samoa also includes an initiative with the Samoa Red Cross Society (SRCS) and the Adventists Disaster Relief Agency (ADRA) to intensify public education on COVID-19. It builds on the early COVID-19 sensitization sessions held for approximately 200 village chiefs, mayors, religious leaders and women's community group representatives from the four inhabited Samoan Islands Upolu, Savai'i, Manono and Apolima. As part of the initiative, WHO collaborated with the Ministry of Health and the SRCS to develop a COVID-19 training toolkit to deliver standardized information sessions on COVID-19. The toolkit includes a component on home-based care. In July, WHO joined the SRCS in Manono and Apolima, two of Samoa's smaller islands, where more assessments were conducted and hygiene kit care packages and water were distributed to vulnerable families. The unavailability of clean water for hand-washing, cooking and general hygiene is a barrier to preventing and managing COVID-19 infection. This and other barriers are the backbone of WHO's collaboration with SRCS and ADRA to better understand families' vulnerability to COVID-19 and to provide them with the hygiene supplies. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

        "title": "Protecting older people against COVID-19",
        "content": "Protecting older people against COVID-19 The WHO Western Pacific Region is home to more than a third of the world’s older people. For many of these 240 million people aged over 65 years, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thrown up new challenges. COVID-19 affects older adults disproportionately, especially those living in long-term care facilities, with a significant impact on mortality and morbidity. To ensure their health and well-being during the pandemic, WHO has recently published a range of guidance documents and tools for long-term care facilities, older people and communities. It is complemented by an online course to improve infection prevention and control in long-term care facilities. Preventing and controlling infection in residential facilities Older people living in long-term care facilities are in frequent contact with caregivers and other staff working in the facility. Residents may also receive visits from family members and friends, increasing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Indeed, outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported at long-term care facilities in countries of the Western Pacific Region. To address these challenges, WHO has published guidance on preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 in such facilities and at home. A communication toolkit and a preparedness checklist have also been published to support education and training of staff and to ensure that facilities are prepared for possible outbreaks of COVID-19. “The toolkit has advice for facility managers, staff, residents and family members,” explains Hiromasa Okayasu, WHO Coordinator for Healthy Ageing in the Western Pacific Region. “The measures described are simple and easy to put into place and will make a significant difference in protecting residents against COVID-19.” WHO also offers a free, online course for long-term care facility staff in the context of COVID-19 . Its four modules address different aspects of infection prevention and control. Participants learn to describe infection prevention and control principles and practices relevant to long-term care facilities for patient and staff safety, apply the COVID-19 long-term care facility preparedness checklist to their place of work, identify practices to safely manage long-term care facility residents, and understand how to support themselves and each other as staff of long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Staying well at home Older people living at home are also facing new difficulties during this pandemic. Physical distancing and lockdown measures mean that many older people are not able to carry out their regular activities. Gunhee Lee, a 75-year-old woman from the Republic of Korea is finding this change difficult. “Before the COVID-19 outbreak, I was very active,” she says. She participated in hobby groups, volunteered to help ill neighbours and sold home-made traditional food and drinks at a local café. But the pandemic has put a stop to her activities. “I try to stay at home; we need to follow the physical distancing measures strictly,” she explains. To help older people stay well at home, WHO has published a self-care guide . Designed for older people and their caregivers, it focuses on what can be done at home to improve health and well-being, such as personal health checks, physical activity and eating well. Community-based integrated care Staying connected to others is another key part of maintaining health and well-being. However, with many welfare centres and other social services disrupted during this time, social isolation of older people is a growing concern. Older people with difficulty using digital technology could experience a disconnect from their community. A recent WHO guidance provides advice on how to help older people stay connected as we adapt to the “new normal”. For Gunhee Lee, for example, receiving regular phone calls from her local welfare centre has made a huge difference. “I’m always so happy to hear their voices,” she says. “They also send text messages to inform us of the district’s contact tracing and updates on new cases.” Using community-based resources, such as welfare centres, is the key to promoting the health of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future. With health, long-term care and social sectors working together, older people can access person-centred, integrated care in the community so they can “age in place”. A new future COVID-19 has resulted in many challenges for older people, but it also presents new opportunities. The new WHO guidance and tools can help long-term care facilities, communities and countries become safer and create a “new future” in which older people can safely thrive. This lays the foundation for age-friendly societies where older people’s contributions are supported and valued – which benefits everyone, no matter their age. Gunhee Lee remains optimistic. “It’s tough right now. We all feel trapped and tired,” she says. “But as they say, when the bitterness ends, the sweetness begins. We can overcome COVID-19 and create a better future.” Related videos: Documents"

More than 99% of the population live in areas where the air pollution is above WHO air quality guidelines and 4.2 million deaths are attributed to ambient air pollution each year. Ambient and household air pollution can come from similar processes such as incomplete combustion of fuels or chemical reactions between gases. However, the specific source of the combustion process can vary. For example, household activities such as cooking and heating with dirty technologies, and lighting with kerosene, emits a range of health harmful pollutants indoors, while activities such as high temperature combustion in vehicles, industries and power generating facilities contribute to ambient air pollution. Activities such as boiling water for bathing or cooking animal fodder can also add to household air pollution exposures. Pollutants with the strongest evidence for public health concern include particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). Health problems can occur as a result of both short- and long-term exposure to these various pollutants. For some pollutants, there are no thresholds below which adverse effects do not occur. Pollutants which are included in the WHO global air quality guidelines are presented firstly followed by pollutants for which there are good practice statements but no quantitative values. Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM) refers to inhalable particles, composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust or water. PM can be of different size and is generally defined by their aerodynamic diameter, with PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 the most common in the regulatory framework and relevant for health. Sources of the largest particles called coarse particles (particles with diameter between 2.5 µm and 10 µm) will mainly consist of pollen, sea spray and wind-blown dust from erosion, agricultural spaces, roadways and mining operations. The finer particles (i.e., PM 2.5 ) can be derived from primary sources (e.g., combustion of fuels in power generation facilities, industries or vehicles) and secondary sources (e.g., chemical reactions between gases). The greatest source of particulate matter around the home is generally the combustion of polluting fuels in open hearths or poorly vented, inefficient stoves or space heaters. In addition to household activities like cooking, space heating, and lighting, other activities can be important sources of particulate matter pollution in the home environment, such as preparing animal fodder, heating water for bathing and brewing beverages. In outdoor environments, the main sources are location-specific and can be made up of different different origins but typically include traffic and transportation, industrial activities, power plants, construction sites, waste burning, fires or fields. The health risks associated with particulate matter of less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) are especially well documented. PM is capable of penetrating deep into the lung and enter the bloodstream causing cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease), cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts. Both long-term and short-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure has been further linked to adverse perinatal outcomes and lung cancer. In 2013, it was classified as a cause of lung cancer by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It is also the most widely used indicator for assessing the health effects of exposure to air pollution. Read more about particulate matter in the Air Quality Guidelines . Nitrogen Dioxide Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a reddish-brown gas that is soluble in water, and a strong oxidant. Ambient sources of NO 2 results from high temperature combustion of fuels in processes such as those used for heating, transportation, industry and power generation. Household sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) include equipment that burn fuels such as furnaces, fireplaces and gas stoves and ovens. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide can irritate airways and aggravate respiratory diseases. NO 2 is an important ozone precursor, a pollutant closely linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions. Read more about nitrogen dioxide here and here . Ozone Ground-level ozone (O 3 ) is a major component of smog. It is formed from photochemical reactions with pollutants such volatile organic compounds , carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from vehicles, and industry. Due to the photochemical nature, the highest levels of ozone are seen during periods of sunny weather. It is worth mentioning that ozone can also be generated by household equipment, such as portable air cleaners. Exposure to excessive ozone can cause problems breathing, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and lead to lung disease. Read more about ozone here and here . Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, coal, natural gas and kerosene in simple stoves, open fires, wick lamps, furnaces, fireplaces. The predominant source of carbon monoxide (CO) in ambient air is from motor vehicles. Carbon monoxide diffuses across the lung tissues and into the bloodstream, making it difficult for the body’s cells to bind to oxygen. This lack of oxygen damages tissues and cells. Exposure to carbon monoxide can cause difficulties breathing, exhaustion, dizziness, and other flu-like symptoms. Exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be deadly. Read more about carbon monoxide here and here . Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) is a colourless gas that is readily soluble in water. It is predominantly derived from the combustion of fossil fuels for domestic heating, industries and power generation. Exposure to SO 2 is associated with asthma hospital admissions and emergency room visits. Read more about sulfur dioxide here and here . Lead Lead (Pb) and lead particulate compounds can be found in the home in contaminated dust from products such as paints, ceramics, pipes and plumbing materials, solders, gasoline, batteries, ammunition, and cosmetics. Lead can also be found in ambient air from vehicle exhaust of fuel with lead. Lead poses health risks of particular concern for children and pregnant women. The health impacts for children exposed to lead include behaviour and learning problems, lower IQ and hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing problems, and anemia. In rare cases, ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma and even death. For pregnant women, health risks include reduced growth of the fetus and premature birth. Adults exposed to lead also have a higher risk of cardiovascular effects increased blood pressure, the incidence of hypertension, decreased kidney function and risk of reproductive problems in both men and women. Read more about lead poisoning here and here . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are present in the atmosphere in particulate form. They are a group of chemicals formed primarily from incomplete combustion of organic matter (e.g. cooking of meat) as well as fossil fuels in coke ovens, diesel engines and wood-burning stoves. They are also emitted from tobacco smoke. Short-term exposure can irritate eyes and breathing passages. Long-term exposure to PAH has been linked to lung cancer. Read more about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons here . Formaldehyde Formaldehyde is a colourless gas with a pungent smell. It is one of the most common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found indoors. Formaldehyde is emitted from building materials (e.g. particleboard, plywood, glue, paints) as well as household and personal care products (e.g. drapes, carpets, cleaning products, hair sprays). Additional indoor sources may be combustion processes such as smoking, heating, cooking, or candle or incense burning. Short-term exposure to formaldehyde can lead to eye, nose and throat irritation as well as increased allergic sensitization. However, long-term exposure to formaldehyde has been associated with nasopharyngeal cancer. Read more about formaldehyde here . Radon: Radon (Rn) is a radioactive gas that emanates from certain rock and soil formations, concentrating in the basement or ground levels of homes, in the absence of inadequate ventilation or evacuation systems. Recent studies on indoor radon in Europe, North America and Asia indicate that lung cancers attributable to radon may range from 3% to 14%, making radon the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers. Read more about radon here . The table below highlights the recommended guideline value for each pollutant. 5 μg/m 3 15 μg/m 3 Annual 24-hour 15 μg/m 3 45 μg/m 3 Annual 24-hour 10 μg/m 3 25 μg/m 3 Annual 24-hour 0.5 μg/m 3 The pollutants highlighted below do not have quantitative guideline limits, but they are included in the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines due to their potential health impacts. Black carbon Black carbon is a major component of PM 2.5 and it is sometimes referred to as soot and its main sources are from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass. It can be emitted both from anthropogenic (e.g. diesel vehicles, biomass cookstoves) and natural (e.g. wildfires) sources. It is also a potent warming agent in the atmosphere and contributes to regional environmental disruption and accelerates glacier melting. Short- and long-term exposure to black carbon has been associated with cardiovascular health effects and premature mortality. Read more about the health effects of black carbon here and here . Ultrafine Particles Ultrafine particles (UFP) are particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 0.1 micrometer. The main source of UFP is combustion processes in transportation (e.g. vehicles, aviation, shipping), industrial and power plants and residential heating. Exposure to UFP can increase the likelihood of pulmonary, cardiovascular and ischaemic heart diseases. Read more ultrafine particles here or here . Mould Moisture build-up, mould and bacterial growth can occur as a result of structural building faults, inadequate heating and insulation, or inadequate ventilation. These produce allergens and irritants that can cause asthma attacks among those allergic to mould. They also irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs of both mould-allergic and non-allergic people. Read more about damp and mould here or here .

        "content": "Ambient (outdoor) air pollution Key facts Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to child health In 2019, 99% of the world’s population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met. The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in some regions. Overview Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2019; this mortality is due to exposure to fine particulate matter, which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. WHO estimates that in 2019, some 68% of outdoor air pollution related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 14% were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14% were due to acute lower respiratory infections, and 4% of deaths were due to lung cancers. People living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 89% (of the 4.2 million premature deaths) occurring in these areas. The greatest burden is found in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death. Policies reducing air pollution Addressing air pollution, which is the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases , is key to protecting public health. Most sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and this demands concerted action by local, national and regional level policy-makers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning and agriculture. There are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution: for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas); for energy: ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating and lighting; for transport: shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content; for urban planning: improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more green and compact, and thus energy efficient; for power generation: increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation); for municipal and agricultural waste management: strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing, as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste – where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical; and for health-care activities: putting health services on a low-carbon development path can support more resilient and cost-efficient service delivery, along with reduced environmental health risks for patients, health workers and the community. In supporting climate friendly policies, the health sector can display public leadership while also improving health service delivery. Pollutants Particulate matter (PM) PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. There is strong evidence for the negative health impacts associated with exposure to this pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. Carbon monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, charcoal, natural gas and kerosene. Ozone (O 3 ) Ozone at ground level – not to be confused with the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere – is one of the major constituents of photochemical smog and it is formed through the reaction with gases in the presence of sunlight. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) NO 2 is a gas that is commonly released from the combustion of fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors. Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) SO 2 is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. To read more details about these pollutants and other types, please visit this page . Air quality guidelines The WHO Global air quality guidelines (AQG) offer global guidance on thresholds and limits for key air pollutants that pose health risks. These guidelines are of a high methodological quality and are developed through a transparent, evidence-based decision-making process. In addition to the guideline values, the WHO Global air quality guidelines provide interim targets to promote a gradual shift from high to lower concentrations and their associated health benefits. For example, through the achievement of interim target one (35 µg/m 3 ), around 300 000 deaths would be saved worldwide annually. The guidelines also offer qualitative statements on good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (PM), for example black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms, for which there is insufficient quantitative evidence to derive AQG levels. WHO response Recognizing the gravity and urgency of the problem, all WHO Member States approved resolution A68.8, “Health and the Environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution,” at the World Health Assembly in 2015, complemented by a road map for action the following year. WHO, as the coordinating authority on international health, supports countries in protecting public health through evidence-based policies and actions. Considering the significant health burden and the multiple potential benefits of interventions, WHO supports countries by providing evidence, building institutional capacity and leveraging the health argument to convene sectors to tackle air pollution. To support reducing air pollution levels and to protect populations from health risks, WHO’s Air Quality and Health Unit works in three cross-cutting areas: 1. knowledge, evidence and measuring progress 2. institutional capacity building and technical support 3. leadership and coordination. Member States and sub-national entities are typically responsible for the implementation and monitoring of policies to promote air quality for health. Successful policies and solid governance depend on coordinated action between a variety of stakeholders and sec- tors. Cooperation with other UN agencies and non-state actors is essential and is integrated into WHO’s work to ensure synergies and maximize impact on the ground.

        "title": "Household air pollution",
        "content": "Household air pollution Key facts Around 2.1 billion people worldwide (around a third of the global population) cook using open fires or inefficient stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal, which generates harmful household air pollution. Household air pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year in 2020, including over 237 000 deaths of children under the age of 5. The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. Household air pollution exposure leads to noncommunicable diseases including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Women and children, typically responsible for household chores such as cooking collecting firewood, bear the greatest health burden from the use of polluting fuels and technologies in homes. It is essential to expand use of clean fuels and technologies to reduce household air pollution and protect health. These include solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Overview Worldwide, around 2.1 billion people still cook using solid fuels (such as wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and dung) and kerosene in open fires and inefficient stoves (1) . Most of these people are poor and live in low- and middle-income countries. There is a large discrepancy in access to cleaner cooking alternatives between urban and rural areas: in 2021, only 14% of people in urban areas relied on polluting fuels and technologies, compared with 49% of the global rural population. Household air pollution is generated by the use of inefficient and polluting fuels and technologies in and around the home that contains a range of health-damaging pollutants, including small particles that penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. In poorly ventilated dwellings, indoor smoke can have levels of fine particles 100 times higher than acceptable. Exposure is particularly high among women and children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth. Reliance on polluting fuels and technologies also require significant time for cooking on an inefficient device, and gathering and preparing fuel. Guidance In light of the widespread use of polluting fuels and stoves for cooking, WHO issued a set of normative guidance, the Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion , which offer practical evidence-based guidance on what fuels and technologies used in the home can be considered clean, including recommendations discouraging use of kerosene and recommending against use of unprocessed coal; specifying the performance of fuels and technologies (in the form of emission rate targets) needed to protect health; and emphasizing the importance of addressing all household energy uses, particularly cooking, space heating and lighting to ensure benefits for health and the environment. WHO defines fuels and technologies that are clean for health at the point of use as solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Without strong policy action, 1.8 billion people are estimated to still lack access to clean fuels and technologies in 2030 (1) . There is a particularly critical need for action in sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth has outpaced access to clean cooking, and 923 million people lacked access in 2022. Strategies to increase the adoption of clean household energy include policies that provide financial support to purchase cleaner technologies and fuels, improved ventilation or housing design, and communication campaigns to encourage clean energy use. Impacts on health Each year, 3.2 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributable to the household air pollution caused by the incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking (see household air pollution data for details). Particulate matter and other pollutants in household air pollution inflame the airways and lungs, impair immune response and reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Among these 3.2 million deaths from household air pollution exposure: 32% are from ischaemic heart disease : 12% of all deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for over a million premature deaths annually, can be attributed to exposure to household air pollution; 23% are from stroke : approximately 12% of all deaths due to stroke can be attributed to the daily exposure to household air pollution arising from using solid fuels and kerosene at home; 21% are due to lower respiratory infection : exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood LRI and is responsible for 44% of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years old. Household air pollution is a risk for acute lower respiratory infections in adults and contributes to 22% of all adult deaths due to pneumonia; 19% are from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): 23% of all deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults in low- and middle-income countries are due to exposure to household air pollution; and 6% are from lung cancer : approximately 11% of lung cancer deaths in adults are attributable to exposure to carcinogens from household air pollution caused by using kerosene or solid fuels like wood, charcoal or coal for household energy needs. Household air pollution accounted for the loss of an estimated 86 million healthy life years in 2019, with the largest burden falling on women living in low- and middle-income countries. Almost half of all deaths due to lower respiratory infection among children under 5 years of age are caused by inhaling particulate matter (soot) from household air pollution. There is also evidence of links between household air pollution and low birth weight, tuberculosis, cataract, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers. Impacts on health equity, development and climate change Significant policy changes are needed to rapidly increase the number of people with access to clean fuels and technologies by 2030 to address health inequities, achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and mitigate climate change. Women and children disproportionately bear the greatest health burden from polluting fuels and technologies in homes as they typically labour over household chores such as cooking and collecting firewood and spend more time exposed to harmful smoke from polluting stoves and fuels. Gathering fuel increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and consumes considerable time for women and children – limiting education and other productive activities. In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence while gathering fuel. Many of the fuels and technologies used by households for cooking, heating and lighting present safety risks. The ingestion of kerosene by accident is the leading cause of childhood poisonings, and a large fraction of the severe burns and injuries occurring in low- and middle-income countries are linked to household energy use for cooking, heating and lighting (2) . The lack of access to electricity for over 750 million (1) people forces households to rely on polluting devices and fuels, such as kerosene lamps for lighting, thus making them exposed to very high levels of fine particulate matter. The time spent using and preparing fuel for inefficient, polluting devices constrains other opportunities for health and development, like studying, leisure time, or productive activities. Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Household air pollution is also a major contributor to ambient (outdoor) air pollution . WHO response WHO provides technical support and capacity building to countries and regions to evaluate and scale-up health-promoting household fuels and technologies. To address household air pollution and its negative impact on health, WHO: develops guidelines for indoor air quality and household fuel combustion , to provide health-based recommendations on the types of fuels and technologies that protect health, and effective strategies for the dissemination and adoption of cleaner household fuels and technologies; builds capacity at the country and regional level through direct consultations and workshops on household energy and health; maintains the global household energy database to monitor progress in the transition to cleaner fuels and stove combinations in households, reporting as the custodian agency for reporting on SDG indicator 7.1.2 , the proportion of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies . WHO also supports assessments of burden of disease from household air pollution resulted from the use of polluting fuel and technologies; develops and updates tools and resources such as the Clean Household Energy Solutions Toolkit (CHEST) to help countries identify stakeholders working on household energy and public health to design, implement and monitor policies addressing household energy for better health; supports governments to estimate costs and health benefits of implementing household energy interventions ; convenes the global Health and Energy Platform of Action (HEPA) , which strengthens cooperation between the health and energy sectors to ensure universal access to clean and sustainable energy for households and health-care facilities in order to protect health; works with countries, researchers and other partners to harmonize methods of planning and evaluation across settings for consistent and rigorous household energy and health assessments; leads efforts with countries and surveying agencies to enhance, harmonize and pilot questions for national censuses and surveys , including assessing the health risks of using polluting household energy, as well as differentiated gender impacts from household energy practices; and develops guidance and resources for integrating clean household energy into global health and climate change initiatives as well as decision-support tools.

        "content": "WHO Ambient Air quality database Air Quality database Updates 2024 (Version Sixth) Released on 31 Jan 2024 – 6th edition (V6.1) The WHO Ambient Air Quality Database compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), particulate matter of a diameter equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM 10 ) or equal or smaller than 2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ) which aim at representing an average for the city or town as a whole, rather than for individual stations. Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. In order to present air quality data that represent human exposure, we used mainly urban measurements, comprising urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas or rural areas and industrial areas close to urban settlements. The database is updated regularly every 2-3 years since 2011. The data compiled in this database is used as input to derive the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 11.6.2, Air quality in cities, for which WHO is custodial agency. The primary sources of data were official countries reports sent to WHO upon request, official national and subnational reports, national and subnational websites that contain measurements of PM 10 , PM 2.5 or NO 2 . The Sixth version of the database (V6.1) was released in January 2024 and currently hosts data from 7 182 human settlements in more than 120 member states. Limitations Data from different countries are of limited comparability because of: The coverage is not comprehensive and only captures a small fraction of cities in some countries Omission of data which are known to exist, but which could not yet be accessed due to language issues or limited accessibility The measure is localized (city average are an average of ground measurement stations) Large heterogeneity of measurement methods and techniques Different temporal coverage of certain measurements included: if only part of the year was covered, the measurement may significantly deviate from the annual mean due to seasonal variability Possible inclusion of data which were not eligible for this database due to insufficient information to assess compliance Heterogeneous quality of measurements What it can do: ✅️ serve as input data in models to estimates air pollution exposure with topographic, population and satellite data together with chemicals transport models among other. ✅️ contribute to advocate for better monitoring of air quality everywhere ✅️ acknowledge growing effort of the number of monitoring stations around the world ✅️ raise awareness about the importance for publicly available data and of high quality ✅️ serve as a building block to calculate the mortality and morbidity of air pollution- according to the latest World Health Organization estimates, 4.2 million died in 2019 due to breathing bad air quality. 4.2 million that developed cardiovascular diseases like stroke or heart disease, lung cancer or COPD. What it cannot do: ❌️ draw direct comparison between countries ❌️ rank the most polluted cities Ideally, the monitoring data used to calculate the average annual PM and NO 2 concentrations should be collected throughout the year, for several years, to reduce bias owing to seasonal fluctuations or to a non-representative year. Care should be taken that the monitors used are not unduly influenced by a single source of pollution (i.e. a power plant, factory or highway); rather, the monitors should reflect exposures over a wide area. Although it is likely that PM and NO 2 data will be available only for larger cities, residents of agglomerations of less than 100 000 inhabitants and of rural areas are also exposed to PM and NO 2 from local industrial activity, transportation, biomass fuels, open burning and regional haze.

WHO is a custodian agency for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 11.6.2 Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted), as displayed below. This indicator aims to inform progress on the target 11.6 set by the United Nations as “By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management:, as part of the broader goal 11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Because ground monitors are not available everywhere, WHO uses modelled estimates, which rely, among other input data, on the information available in the WHO Ambient Air Quality Database.

        "content": "The impacts of climate change on human health are predicted to be unfavourable, varied, and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable population groups who are most exposed and least able to adapt. Likely impacts in many countries include those associated with extreme weather events and natural disasters, lack of sufficient quantities and quality of fresh water, impacts of compromised food security, and increased incidence of communicable diseases including vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, tick-borne diseases and plague are particularly susceptible for a number of reasons: the geographical distribution and behaviour of vectors and their hosts are intimately associated with environmental determinants, and transmission dynamics tend to favour warmer, wetter environments. Human responses to climate change, such as increased urbanization following farming failures and storage of water for household use, may also place populations at risk of vector borne diseases. Member States in Western Pacific Region have endorsed resolutions and developed national adaptation programmes of action and other climate change vulnerability analyses and plans to address and respond to climate change and health threats. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office works closely with Member states to build capacity at country and regional levels to minimize the consequences of vector-borne diseases for populations in areas that are prone to climate change.

        "content": "Health is significantly influenced by the changing climate. Populations around the world struggle with food and water security, face the threat of outbreak of waterborne and vectorborne diseases, and experience increased pressure on scarce resources triggering climate-related migration and conflicts. Nowhere can these threats lead to more serious consequences than in the Pacific Island countries and areas. The combination of extreme exposure to climate-related disasters, such as cyclones, floods, and droughts, and the long-term rise in sea level coupled with geographically dispersed populations in remote small islands with fragile health systems, means climate change is an existential threat to Pacific islanders. WHO has been working with the vulnerable countries in the past decade to develop national climate change and health action plans based on the vulnerability and capacity assessments. With WHO support, the least developed countries (LDCs) in the Pacific and the Mekong areas are starting large-scale multi-year projects to build climate-resilient health systems. In addition, Pacific Island countries are working together to implement the Pacific Action Plan on Climate Change and Health in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Initiative. Through the implementation of the Action Plan, Pacific Island countries will benefit from the stronger political, technical and financial support in protecting their citizens from climate-sensitive diseases and building climate-resilient health systems.

Compared to 15 years ago, when the previous edition of these guidelines was published, there is now a much stronger body of evidence to show how air pollution affects different aspects of health at even lower concentrations than previously understood. But here’s what hasn’t changed: every year, exposure to air pollution is still estimated to cause millions of deaths and the loss of healthy years of life. The burden of disease attributable to air pollution is now estimated to be on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking. In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a landmark resolution on air quality and health, recognizing air pollution as a risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cancer, and the economic toll they take.

Analysing the latest data on the environment-disease nexus and the devastating impact of environmental hazards and risks on global health, backed up by expert opinion, this report covers more than 100 diseases and injuries. The updated analysis for the year 2016 (results can be downloaded below under “Updated 2016 data tables”) shows that 24% of global deaths (and 28% of deaths among children under five) are due to modifiable environmental factors. Sixty-eight percent of these attributable deaths and 51% of attributable DALYs could be estimated with evidence-based comparative risk assessment methods, the assessments of other environmental exposures were completed through additional epidemiological estimates and expert opinion. Ischaemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and unintentional injuries head the list. People in low- and middle income countries bear the greatest disease burden. These assessments should add impetus to coordinating global efforts to promote healthy environments – often through well-established, cost-effective interventions. This analysis will inform those who want to better understand the transformational spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by Heads of State in September 2015. The results of the analysis underscore the pressing importance of stronger intersectoral action to create healthier environments that will contribute to sustainably improving the lives of millions around the world.

A new coalition of Asia-Pacific countries, backed by WHO, plans to change that Over 20 WHO Western Pacific Member States gather in Singapore to address healthcare sector’s role in contributing to, and tackling, the climate crisis Singapore, 18 September 2025 – Globally, 5% of total climate emissions come from the healthcare sector, contributing to the ever-mounting global threat of climate change. To address this specific challenge, the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office and the Centre for Sustainable Medicine at the National University of Singapore convened representatives from more than 20 Asia-Pacific countries* to chart a roadmap to transform the region’s healthcare systems to adapt to the changing climate, lower their carbon emissions, and become more environmentally sustainable. The Inaugural Western Pacific Action Forum on Climate-Resilient and Sustainable Health Systems spotlighted the urgent need to invest in climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems – a win-win strategy that helps protect lives, strengthens national preparedness against multiple hazards, and reduces costs through sustainable and efficient measures. Climate-resilient health systems reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events, natural hazards, disease outbreaks and compound crises. Most health system carbon emissions stem from supply chain activities. Measuring baseline emissions can generate efficiency and savings that may be reinvested to protect health. Integrated approaches not only improve health outcomes but also support national climate and development goals. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, through its Asia-Pacific Centre for Environment and Health, is working with Member States to strengthen and expand the global Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH). Malaysia recently became the eleventh country in the Region to join ATACH, swiftly followed by the Cook Islands as the twelfth, reinforcing regional momentum. Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, opened the Forum with a strong call to action, stating, “The climate crisis is projected to cause an additional 250 000 deaths every year between 2030 and 2050. Investing in climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems is therefore one of the smartest, and possibly one of the least complex, choices we can make. It saves lives today while preparing our communities, and the health systems that safeguard them, for the future.” Mr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information, and Ministry of National Development, Singapore, reaffirmed his country’s commitment to climate action in the health sector. “Singapore is taking steps to lower our healthcare sector emissions … The actions we take will not only safeguard the health of our people but also strengthen the resilience and sustainability of our healthcare system in the face of mounting climate change challenges. By working closely together, we can transform the way healthcare is delivered, creating a healthier future for both people and planet.” Stressing the importance of collaboration across sectors, Dr Susan Mercado, Director for Programme Management, WHO Western Pacific, emphasized, “The Forum provided us with an opportunity for countries to share experiences and learn from one another. Almost 99% of the world’s population breathes air with pollution levels exceeding WHO air quality limits, reminding us that no country is immune. Regional collaboration, recognizing that all countries are ultimately connected, is key to accelerating climate and health action.” The Forum aimed to foster policy and budgetary commitments to embed climate resilience and low-carbon strategies into national health system planning and implementation. Over two days in Singapore, participants engaged in technical sessions, policy dialogue and knowledge exchange designed to inspire solutions, strengthen partnerships and accelerate implementation. Professor Nick Watts, the Director of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine at the National University of Singapore, spoke about the broader vision, stressing, “This is not only about protecting people’s health but also about contributing to climate and development goals, especially with the finish line of the Sustainable Development Goals barely five years away. A healthier, more resilient future is still possible if we act together.” *Countries participating in the Forum are (in alphabetical order): Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Mongolia, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Viet Nam.

SAFER was developed to deliver health and development gains in order to meet global, regional and country health and development goals and targets and to reduce human suffering and pain caused by the harmful use of alcohol. The objective of the initiative is to provide support for Member States in reducing the harmful use of alcohol by strengthening the ongoing implementation of the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, the Global alcohol action plan and other WHO and United Nations instruments – including WHO’s Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs2 and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target 3.5 (i.e. Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol). There is a substantial knowledge available about the magnitude of alcohol related harm and effective interventions to reduce this harm. Key decisions have been made in WHO and in UN to give alcohol a high priority globally and to implement effective solutions; it is time to deliver. Thus SAFER will be focusing on the most cost-effective priority interventions (“best buys”) using a set of WHO tools and resources to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm: S trengthen restrictions on alcohol availability A dvance and enforce drink driving countermeasures F acilitate access to screening, brief interventions, and treatment E nforce bans or comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising, sponsorship, and promotion R aise prices on alcohol through excise taxes and pricing policies SAFER consists of three components working together to support delivery of the WHO “best buys” and the WHO global alcohol strategy: 1. A WHO-led package of technical guidance on effective policy and program interventions. 2. A WHO/UN-led operational programme focusing on country action. 3. A multi-stakeholder communications and advocacy campaign The implementation of the five SAFER interventional will be led by the relevant Member States and the Global SAFER initiative will be coordinated and managed by WHO Headquarters and its regional and country offices in collaboration with UNDP and the United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs and with strong involvement from participating Member States and civil society organizations. The Global Alcohol Policy Alliance, Movendi International, the NCD Alliance and Vital Strategies are already committed to coordinating civil society engagement in promoting and implementing SAFER All activities under SAFER will require approval by WHO in accordance with the WHO Framework for Engagement with Non-State actors. All partners of the SAFER initiative will be ambassadors of the program and will hold a responsibility to advocate and promote the initiative both collectively and individually."

        "content": "Overview During the Sixty-third session of the World Health Assembly, held in Geneva in May 2010, the 193 Member States of WHO reached an historical consensus on a global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by adopted resolution WHA63.13. The adopted resolution and endorsed strategy gives guidance to both Member States and to the WHO Secretariat on ways to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The vision behind the global strategy is improved health and social outcomes for individuals, families and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The global strategy aims to give guidance for action at all levels; to set priority areas for global action; and to recommend a portfolio of policy options and measures that could be considered for implementation and adjusted as appropriate at the national level, taking into account national circumstances, such as religious and cultural contexts, national public health priorities, as well as resources, capacities and capabilities.

        "content": "Alcohol Key facts Alcohol or alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, a psychoactive and toxic substance that can cause dependence. Worldwide, around 2.6 million deaths were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019. Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300 000 deaths from communicable diseases. The alcohol-attributable mortality was heaviest among men, accounting for 2 million deaths compared to 600 000 deaths among women, in 2019. An estimated 400 million people, or 7% of the world’s population aged 15 years and older, lived with alcohol use disorders. Of this, 209 million people (3.7% of the adult world population) lived with alcohol dependence. Alcohol consumption, even at low levels can bring health risks, but most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption. Effective alcohol control interventions exist and should be utilized more, at the same time it is important for people to know risks associated with alcohol consumption and take individual actions to protect from its harmful effects. Overview Alcohol and alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which is a psychoactive and toxic substance with dependence-producing properties. Alcohol has been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated with significant health risks and harms. Worldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women. The highest levels of alcohol-related deaths per 100 000 persons are observed in the WHO European and African Regions with 52.9 deaths and 52.2 deaths per 100 000 people, respectively. People of younger age (20–39 years) are disproportionately affected by alcohol consumption with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths occurring within this age group in 2019. The data on global alcohol consumption in 2019 shows that an estimated 400 million people aged 15 years and older live with alcohol use disorders, and an estimated 209 million live with alcohol dependence. There has been some progress; from 2010 to 2019, the number of alcohol-attributable deaths per 100 000 people decreased by 20.2% globally. There has been a steady increase in the number of countries developing national alcohol policies. Almost all countries implement alcohol excise taxes. However, countries report continued interference from the alcohol industry in policy development. Based on 2019 data, about 54% out of 145 reporting countries had national guidelines/standards for specialized treatment services for alcohol use disorders, but only 46% of countries had legal regulations to protect the confidentiality of people in treatment. Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in all countries where such data are available. Health risks of alcohol use Alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development, occurrence and outcomes. Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders. An estimated 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019. Alcohol is an established carcinogen and alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, head and neck, oesophageal and colorectal cancers. In 2019, 4.4% of cancers diagnosed globally and 401 000 cancer deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption also causes significant harm to others, not just to the person consuming alcohol. A significant part of alcohol-attributable disease burden arises from injuries such as road traffic accidents. In 2019, of a total of 298 000 deaths from alcohol-related road crashes, 156 000 deaths were caused by someone else’s drinking. Other injuries, intentional or unintentional, include falls, drowning, burns, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and suicide. A causal relationship has been established between alcohol use and the incidence or outcomes of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of having a child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the most severe form of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with developmental disabilities and birth defects. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can also increase the risk of pre-term birth complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery. Younger people are disproportionately negatively affected by alcohol consumption, with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths in 2019 occurring among people aged between 20 and 39 years. In the long term, harmful and hazardous levels of alcohol consumption can lead to social problems including family problems, issues at work, financial problems, and unemployment. Factors affecting alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm There is no form of alcohol consumption that is risk-free. Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risks and can cause harm. The level of risk depends on several factors, including the amount consumed, frequency of drinking, the health status of the individual, age, sex, and other personal characteristics, as well as the context in which alcohol consumption occurs. Some groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences. Societal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies. The impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking. Most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption. The context plays an important role in the occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly as a result of alcohol intoxication. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on their outcomes and how these evolve over time. There are gender differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. In 2019, 52% of men were current drinkers, while only 35% of women had been drinking alcohol in the last 12 months. Alcohol per capita consumption was, on average, 8.2 litres for men compared to 2.2 litres for women. In 2019, alcohol use was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths among men and 2.4% of all deaths among women. WHO response The Global alcohol action plan 2022–2030, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective, evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination, technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and information systems, and resource mobilization. Implementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. Achieving this will require global, regional and national actions on the levels, patterns and contexts of alcohol consumption and the wider social determinants of health, with a particular focus on implementing high-impact cost effective interventions. It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need. The SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption. The WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world. Achieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance. Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence. Engaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. By working together, with due diligence and protection from conflicts of interest, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be effectively reduced.

        "title": "Road traffic injuries",
        "content": "Road traffic injuries Key facts Approximately 1.19 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. 92% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have around 60% of the world's vehicles. More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. The United Nations General Assembly has set an ambitious target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030 (A/RES/74/299). Overview Every year the lives of approximately 1.19 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Who is at risk? Socioeconomic status More than 90% of road traffic deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Road traffic death rates are highest in the WHO African Region and lowest in the European Region. Even within high-income countries, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes. Age Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. Two thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working age (18–59 years), Sex Males are typically 3 times more likely to be killed in road crashes than females. Risk factors The safe system approach: accommodating human error Transport systems should be responsive to the needs of users and forgiving of human error. The safe system approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users. This approach takes into account people’s vulnerability to serious injuries and recognizes that the system should be designed to accommodate human error. The cornerstones of this approach are safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe road users, all of which must be addressed in order to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injuries. Speeding An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65 km/h). In car-to-car side impacts the fatality risk for car occupants is 85% at 65 km/h. Driving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances Driving under the influence of alcohol and any psychoactive substance or drug increases the risk of a crash that results in death or serious injuries. In the case of drink-driving, the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver's BAC is ≥ 0.04 g/dl. In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of a fatal crash occurring among those who have used amphetamines is about 5 times the risk of someone who hasn't. Non-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints Correct helmet use can reduce the risk of death in a crash by more than 6 times and the risk of brain injury by up to 74%. Wearing a seat-belt can reduce the risk of death among vehicle occupants by up to 50%. The use of child restraints can lead to a 71% reduction in deaths among infants. Distracted driving There are many types of distractions that can lead to impaired driving. The distraction caused by mobile phones is a growing concern for road safety. Drivers using mobile phones are approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers not using a mobile phone. Using a phone while driving slows reaction times (notably braking reaction time, but also reaction to traffic signals), and makes it difficult to keep in the correct lane, and to keep the correct following distances. Hands-free phones are not much safer than hand-held phone sets. Texting considerably increases the risk of a crash. Unsafe road infrastructure The design of roads can have a considerable impact on their safety. Ideally, roads should be designed keeping in mind the safety of all road users. This would mean making sure that there are adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points and other traffic calming measures can be critical to reducing the risk of injury among these road users. Unsafe vehicles Safe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries’ manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries – both to those in the vehicle and those out of it – is considerably increased. Inadequate post-crash care Delays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic crash increase the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after a crash has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: delays of minutes can make the difference between life and death. Improving post-crash care requires ensuring access to timely prehospital care, and improving the quality of both prehospital and hospital care, such as through specialist training programmes. Inadequate law enforcement of traffic laws If traffic laws on drink-driving, seat-belt wearing, speed limits, helmets and child restraints are not enforced, they cannot bring about the expected reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries related to specific behaviours. Thus, if traffic laws are not enforced or are perceived as not being enforced, it is likely they will not be complied with and therefore will have very little chance of influencing behaviour. Effective enforcement includes establishing, regularly updating, and enforcing laws at the national, municipal, and local levels that address the above mentioned risk factors. It includes also the definition of appropriate penalties. Prevention Road traffic injuries can be prevented. Governments must take action to address road safety in a holistic manner. This requires involvement from multiple sectors such as transport, police, health and education, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations. It requires actions that address the safety of roads, vehicles and all road users. Effective interventions include designing safer infrastructure and incorporating road safety features into land-use and transport planning, improving the safety features of vehicles; enhancing post-crash care for victims of road traffic crashes; setting and enforcing laws relating to key risks, and raising public awareness. WHO response WHO works with Member States and partners across sectors to support road safety evaluation, implementation and planning. As the lead agency for road safety in the United Nations, WHO plays a key role in guiding global efforts by advocating for road safety at the highest levels, compiling and sharing good practices and raising awareness of road safety. WHO serves as the secretariat for the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–2030, which aims to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by at least 50% by 2030. This includes convening a global network of heads of national road safety agencies, producing global status reports to track progress, and providing technical assistance. WHO works with a range of partners to provide technical support to countries. For example, WHO works with the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS) to reduce fatalities and injuries from road traffic crashes in a range of low- and middle-income countries. WHO chairs the UN Road Safety Collaboration mechanism and organizes and hosts, with key partners, high profile advocacy events such as UN road safety weeks and the annual World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.

        "content": "Noncommunicable diseases Key facts Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) killed at least 43 million people in 2021, equivalent to 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths globally. In 2021, 18 million people died from an NCD before age 70 years; 82% of these premature deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Of all NCD deaths, 73% are in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or at least 19 million deaths in 2021, followed by cancers (10 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (over 2 million including kidney disease deaths caused by diabetes). These four groups of diseases account for 80% of all premature NCD deaths. Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution all increase the risk of dying from an NCD. Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs. Overview Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where nearly three quarters of global NCD deaths (32 million) occur. People at risk People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs. These conditions are often associated with older age groups, but about 18 million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 years. NCDs cause more deaths in this age group than all other causes of death combined. Of these premature deaths, 82% are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors contributing to NCDs, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke, or the harmful use of alcohol or air pollution. Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called metabolic risk factors and can lead to cardiovascular disease, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths. Risk factors Behavioural risk factors Behavioural risk factors increase the risk of NCDS, including: tobacco use (including the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke); unhealthy diets, including excess salt, sugar, and fats; harmful use of alcohol; and insufficient physical activity. The social, commercial, and physical environment are key drivers of these behaviours. Metabolic risk factors Behavioural risk factors contribute to four key metabolic changes that increase the risk of NCDs: raised blood pressure (including hypertension); overweight/obesity; high blood glucose levels (including diabetes); and abnormal blood lipids (including high cholesterol). In terms of attributable deaths, the leading metabolic risk factor globally is elevated blood pressure (to which 25% of global NCD deaths are attributed) (1), followed by raised blood glucose and overweight and obesity. Environmental risk factors Several environmental risk factors contribute to NCDs. Air pollution – indoor and outdoor – is the largest of these, accounting for 6.7 million deaths globally, of which about 5.6 million are due to NCDs, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Socioeconomic impact NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target of reducing the probability of death from any of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 years by one third by 2030. Poverty is closely linked with NCDs. The rapid rise in NCDs is predicted to impede poverty reduction initiatives in low-income countries, particularly by increasing household costs associated with health care. Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than people of higher socio-economic positions, especially because they may have limited access to health services. To reduce these inequities, governments must invest in health systems that respond to users’ expectations and needs. Prevention and control An important way to control NCDs is to focus on reducing the risk factors associated with these diseases. Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities. To lessen the impact of NCDs on individuals and society, a comprehensive approach is needed requiring all sectors, including health, finance, transport, education, agriculture, planning and others, to collaborate to reduce the risks associated with NCDs, and to promote interventions to prevent and control them. Investing in better management of NCDs is critical. Management of NCDs includes detecting, screening and treating these diseases, and providing access to palliative care for people in need. High impact essential NCD interventions can be delivered through a primary health care approach to strengthen early detection and timely treatment. Evidence shows such interventions are excellent economic investments because, if provided early to patients, they can reduce the need for more expensive treatment. Countries with inadequate health care coverage are unlikely to provide universal access to essential NCD interventions. NCD management interventions are essential for achieving the SDG target on NCDs. WHO response The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development. As part of the Agenda, heads of state and government committed to develop ambitious national responses, by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment (SDG target 3.4). WHO plays a key leadership role in the coordination and promotion of the global fight against NCDs and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4. In 2019, the World Health Assembly extended the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020 to 2030 and called for the development of an Implementation Roadmap 2023 to 2030 to accelerate progress on preventing and controlling NCDs. The Roadmap supports actions to achieve a set of nine global targets with the greatest impact towards prevention and management of NCDs.

The adopted resolution and endorsed strategy gives guidance to both Member States and to the WHO Secretariat on ways to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The vision behind the global strategy is improved health and social outcomes for individuals, families and communities, with considerably reduced morbidity and mortality due to harmful use of alcohol and their ensuing social consequences. It is envisaged that the global strategy will promote and support local, regional and global actions to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The global strategy aims to give guidance for action at all levels; to set priority areas for global action; and to recommend a portfolio of policy options and measures that could be considered for implementation and adjusted as appropriate at the national level, taking into account national circumstances, such as religious and cultural contexts, national public health priorities, as well as resources, capacities and capabilities.

As part of the effort to prevent and control NCDs, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office promotes the idea that people can be healthier when they make healthier decisions. Insufficient physical activity contributes to 3.2 million deaths and 69.3 million disability-adjusted life-years each year. In 2003, WHO launched the annual “Move for Health” day as a global initiative to promote the benefits of physical activity in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer. One out of two people live in cities in the Western Pacific Region, and many countries continue to go through the process of rapid urbanization. For all the benefits that living in an urban environment brings to citizens, cities also have the potential to contribute to the NCD epidemic. WHO Western Pacific Office supports the process of healthy urbanization through various initiatives. Since 2004, every two years WHO Western Pacific Regional Office recognizes outstanding work in selected areas to encourage cities in the Region to continue to innovate and demonstrate effective and efficient ways of promoting and protecting health of urban populations.

NCDs are the leading causes of death and disability in the Region. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office supports Member States in the prevention and control of NCDs to: Raise priority accorded to NCDs through international cooperation and advocacy. Strengthen national capacity, governance, multisectoral action, and partnerships. Reduce the major modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity. Develop and implement effective legal frameworks. Orient health systems through people-centred health care and universal health coverage. Promote high-quality research and development. Monitor trends, determinants and progress to achieve global, regional and national targets through evidence-based interventions. The Regional Office’s work is guided by the Regional Action Framework for Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and Control in the Western Pacific, which delineates the regional vision, guiding principles, objectives and recommended actions to counter and reverse the growing burden of NCDs. This Regional Action Framework is aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2030 and regional action frameworks that can work together to create a united vision for health in the Western Pacific Region. The regional action plan recognizes that many of the most effective actions necessary to tackle the NCD burden lie outside the health sector. Policies in sectors responsible for education, trade, food, alcohol and urban development need to be as much part of the action on NCDs as the responses from the health sector. A health-in-all-policies approach will increasingly play an important role in rendering visibility to the need for dialogue and consensus on the impact of policies on health in general and the NCD epidemic in particular.

        "content": "WHO calls for action to protect young people from alcohol-related harm Every minute one person dies from alcohol-related harm in the Western Pacific Region. Alcohol is one of the biggest risk factors for deaths among young people in the Region. Young people are especially at risk for alcohol-related injury (e.g. drink-driving), risky sexual behaviour and suicide. \"One in three current drinkers in the Western Pacific aged 15 to 19 has engaged in excessive drinking,\" notes Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. \"Alcohol abuse is associated with depression and anxiety. Excessive drinking is closely linked to self-harm and suicide.\" Young people often underestimate the risks associated with excessive use of alcohol and potentially impaired decision-making. Under the influence of alcohol, they are at higher risk of injury from drink-driving and violence. A driver under the age of 20 with blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 g/dl is 5 times more likely to be involved in a crash than older more experienced drivers. Road crashes involving young people are also more likely to be fatal. Studies have shown that between 48-61% of fatalities among pedestrians are linked to alcohol. Globally, across all age groups, alcohol is estimated to be responsible for 26% and 16% of years of life lost from homicide among males and females respectively. In the general population, alcohol and other substance use disorders are found in 25–50% of all suicides. The risk is further increased when it coexists with depression and other psychiatric illness. Of all deaths from suicide, 22% can be attributed to the use of alcohol. Alcohol consumption can increase the likelihood of young people engaging in risky behaviours such as unsafe sex. The risk of unwanted pregnancies is 14 times greater without modern contraception. Continued drinking while pregnant increases the risk of complications such as premature birth and fetal alcohol syndrome. Unsafe sex also contributes to sexually transmitted infections including the risk of contracting HIV. Regular recreational drinking during adolescence is the clearest predictor of alcohol dependence in adulthood. Over time it increases the risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and liver cirrhosis. These consequences impose significant direct costs to society such as health care related expenses. Indirect costs from lost productivity due to absenteeism, unemployment, decreased output, reduced earnings potential and lost working years due to premature pension or death account for as high as 76–91% of the total burden to society. We can protect young people from the harmful use of alcohol In 2014 at the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on NCDs, Member States pledged to intensify efforts to prevent the needless loss of life from NCDs. This includes setting national targets by 2025 to reduce risk factors and underlying social determinants. The nine voluntary NCD targets include a 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol. Regulations regarding the availability of alcohol, comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising and promotions, and price increases through taxation are cost-effective interventions to address this threat to public health. It is estimated that doubling the tax on alcohol would decrease the number of alcohol-related deaths by 35%, traffic deaths by 11% and sexually transmitted infections by 6%. Added revenue from alcohol tax may also be used to fund health promotion activities. Young people can be powerful agents of change. Across the different social media platforms, between 24-57% of active users are aged 16–24. Social media provides a space for discussion and advocacy for measures to protect themselves. Youth networks and community forums are other tools young people can use to make their voices heard. Advocacy to key stakeholders (e.g. families, educators and policy-makers) is crucial to raise awareness and political commitment for the development of evidence-based policies that reduce alcohol consumption. Health workers can educate and screen young people for problematic behaviour and provide brief intervention and referral at the primary-care level. Integrated care programmes incorporating counselling, rehabilitation and detoxification are more effective than standalone approaches. Media Contacts Mr Ruel E.

        "content": "UN Task Force on NCDs: Joint UN action to respond to NCDs epidemic in Mongolia WHO/N. Lkhagvasuren Two related United Nations missions visited Mongolia from 7-11 September to support the government in reducing premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), a country where the probability of premature death is 32%. Mongolia became the second country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to receive the Joint Mission of the UN Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. The mission included representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The second mission led by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Secretariat and the Ministry of Health and Sports conducted a needs assessment for the implementation of the FCTC. During the visit, mission members met central and local government representatives, the Head of the President’s Secretariat, the Senior Advisor on Health to the Parliament Speaker, health officials from the capital city and its districts, members of scientific and professional associations and civil society. The missions concluded that the epidemic of NCDs, principally cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, is now a serious concern in Mongolia. Half of adult males in the country are tobacco smokers. One out of three people have raised blood pressure, and one out of five have diabetes. They also found that the main risk factors for NCDs in Mongolia are tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. “Usually one or the other of the four risk factors are found to be prevalent in a given country. But Mongolia is unique with all four risk factors on the rise,” says Dr Nick Banatvala from WHO in Geneva. The Joint Mission welcomed the Second National Programme on Prevention and Control of Diseases Caused by Unhealthy Lifestyles 2014-2021 for setting out an approach for all parts of government to work together to combat the NCDs epidemic. However it also advised that the Programme could be strengthened by prioritizing actions on NCDs prevention and control and costing such actions. Overall the experts mentioned that coordination mechanisms within the government and accountability at the political level should be improved. “One conclusion of a recent review of progress in Mongolia carried out for WHO NCD Progress Monitor 2015 is that action implementing cost-effective policies to reduce NCD risk factors needs to be stepped up,” says Dr Banatvala. “The government recognizes that it cannot manage the ever-increasing burden of NCDs by treating people with these conditions and, therefore, prevention is now the first priority,” says G. Shiilegdamba, the Minister of Health and Sports of Mongolia, stressing the importance of further collaboration with the UN agencies on reduction of NCDs. “A whole-of-government, whole-of-society is now required to tackle the four main NCD risk factors,” says Dudley Tarlton, the programme specialist with the UNDP office in Geneva. “This requires a whole-of-UN response to help the government in building national NCD solutions”, he added. “There are a number of inspirational activities and projects on NCD prevention that the province and city district governments had been undertaking,” says Ch. Tsendsuren, the Chair of the Darkhan-Uul province’s local parliament. He brings an example of the “Healthy City” programme initiated by the Darkhan city mayor in 1996-2012 with further extension to 2015 that aimed at creating healthy living environments in urban and rural areas of the province and promotion of healthy lifestyles in communities, families, and for individuals. The FCTC implementation assessment mission applauded the comprehensive revisions made to the law on tobacco control by Mongolia in 2013 which was first adopted soon after Mongolia’s ratification of the FCTC in 2003. Currently, smoking is prohibited in many public places such as schools and restaurants, and advertising of tobacco is banned. Sale of tobacco is also banned within 500 metres of secondary schools and student dormitories. However, the mission also pointed at the missing parts of the law implementation, as accessibility and availability of tobacco products and the lack of health promotion. A further revision of the law in 2015 allowed designated smoking areas in public places, which eroded gains being made in tobacco control in the country. “The tobacco industry is an experienced and powerful enemy that uses all possible means to keep people smoking,” says Dr Carmen Maria Audera-Lopez of the FCTC Secretariat.” So the law should be combined with strong and continued health promotion efforts to inform people about the harm from smoking and second-hand smoke.” The FCTC mission advised Mongolian authorities to re-establish the suspended Health Promotion Foundation, which was funded by 2% of excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and to then channel the resources to the public health sector including health promotion. “Both the prices of and taxes on alcohol and tobacco are very low in Mongolia in comparison with other countries,” says parliamentarian L. Erdenechimeg, the initiator of the 2013 comprehensive revisions to the Tobacco Control Law and the Chair of the Women’s Caucus in the parliament. “Hence we will push for re-establishing the Health Promotion Foundation during the upcoming discussion of the next year’s budget.” She stressed the need to make high-level decisions on alcohol and tobacco control and bring necessary changes to the Law. WHO’s Representative to Mongolia, Dr Soe Nyunt U, says important developments that can improve the NCD situation in this country, are in place including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, and the new UN Development Action Framework being drawn up by UN organizations in Mongolia to support development, including health, for 2017-2021. “The SDGs, Goal 3 specifically, aim to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of all people at all ages. So WHO and UN partners will work as a team to support Mongolia in reducing premature deaths from NCDs,” says Dr Soe Nyunt U, WHO Representative in Mongolia. NCDs in MONGOLIA FACTS BOX: The probability of dying prematurely, between ages 30 and 70, from the four main NCDs is 32%. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death with 43%, followed by cancers (17%), other NCDs, like chronic respiratory disease and diabetes (15%), and injuries (11%). In 2013, 49.1% of men and 5.3% of women currently use tobacco. Among adults aged 15-64, 40.9% (36% of men and 45.8% of women) were exposed to second-hand smoke in homes. In 2014, 20.3% of male students and 8.3% of female students aged 13-15 currently use any tobacco. Among students surveyed, 42.4% reported being exposed to tobacco smoke at home, and 49.8% reported being exposed to tobacco smoke in public places. Total alcohol per capita consumption in 2010 in males was 11.7 litres of pure alcohol, whereas in females 2.2 litres, indicating another major difference in living habits between men and women in Mongolia. The prevalence of raised blood pressure in 2008 in males was 38.1% and in females 27.5%. Obesity rate in 2008 in males was 10.4% and in females 18.3%. (WHO Mongolia Country Profile, 2014.)

        "content": "Alcohol is a toxic and psychoactive substance with dependence producing properties. In many of today’s societies, alcoholic beverages are a routine part of the social landscape for many in the population. This is particularly true for those in social environments with high visibility and societal influence, nationally and internationally, where alcohol frequently accompanies socializing. In this context, it is easy to overlook or discount the health and social damage caused or contributed to by drinking. Alcohol consumption contributes to 2.6 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 4.7% of the global burden of disease. Harmful use of alcohol is accountable for 6,9 % and 2.0% of the global burden of disease for males and females respectively. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature mortality and disability among those aged 20 to 39 years, accounting for 13% of all deaths in this age group. Disadvantaged and especially vulnerable populations have higher rates of alcohol-related death and hospitalization. Alcohol as an intoxicant affects a wide range of structures and processes in the central nervous system and increases the risk for intentional and unintentional injuries and adverse social consequences. Alcohol has considerable toxic effects on the digestive and cardiovascular systems. Alcoholic beverages are classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and increase the risk of several cancer types. Alcohol as an immunosuppressant increases the risk of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and HIV. Both the volume of lifetime alcohol use and a combination of context, frequency of alcohol consumption and amount consumed per occasion increase the risk of the wide range of health and social harms. The risks increase largely in a dose-dependent manner with the volume of alcohol consumed and with frequency of drinking, and exponentially with the amount consumed on a single occasion. Surrogate and illegally produced alcohols can bring an extra health risk from toxic contaminants. Since any alcohol use is associated with some short-term and long-term health risks, it is difficult to define universally applicable population-based thresholds for low-risk drinking. WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and reduce the harmful use of alcohol as a public health priority. The 2010 WHO Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the 2022 WHO Global action plan are the most comprehensive international alcohol policy documents, endorsed by WHO Member States, that provides guidance on reducing the harmful use of alcohol at all levels. WHO’s approach aligns with and furthers work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically target 3.5 on substance abuse, including harmful use of alcohol, and target 3.4 on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and promoting mental health and well-being. WHO has identified that the most cost-effective actions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol include increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, enforcing restrictions on exposure to alcohol advertising, and restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol. In addition, enforcing drink driving countermeasures and securing access to screening, brief interventions, and treatment are effective and ethically sound interventions. The most cost-effective interventions are at the focus of WHO-led SAFER initiative aimed at providing support for Member States in reducing the harmful use of alcohol. WHO’s work provides special attention to reducing harm to people other than the drinker and to populations that are at particular risk from harmful use of alcohol, such as children, adolescents, women of child-bearing age, pregnant and breastfeeding women, indigenous people and other minority groups or groups with low socioeconomic status.

WHO and the UN regional commissions, in cooperation with other partners in the UN Road Safety Collaboration, have developed a Global Plan for the Decade of Action, which was released in October 2021. The Global Plan aligns with the Stockholm Declaration, by emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to road safety, and calling on continued improvements in the design of roads and vehicles; enhancement of laws and law enforcement; and provision of timely, life-saving emergency care for the injured. The Global Plan also reflects the Stockholm Declaration’s promotion of policies to promote walking, cycling and using public transport as inherently healthy and environmentally sound modes of transport. Progress made during the previous Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 has laid the foundation for accelerated action in the years ahead. Among achievements are inclusion of road safety on the global health and development agenda, broad dissemination of scientific guidance on what works, strengthening of partnerships and networks, and mobilization of resources. This new Decade of Action provides an opportunity for harnessing the successes and lessons of previous years and building upon them to save more lives.

During the same period of time, the total alcohol per-capita consumption in the Region increased from 4.8 litres to 7.3 litres, surpassing the global average by almost 10%. The volume of alcohol consumed and patterns of consumption vary substantially between countries and areas. The greatest levels of alcohol consumption occur in high-income countries, with a slight and sustained decrease in alcohol consumption over the past decade. Over the last two decades, alcohol consumption has dramatically increased in low- and middle-income countries and areas. Consumption of alcohol is a preventable risk factor that can cause premature death and over 200 diseases including 7 types of cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cirrhosis of the liver and several infectious diseases. In addition to its risk to noncommunicable diseases, alcohol use has been identified as an important risk factor for different types of injury including road traffic injuries, drowning, fall and violence.

        "title": "Antimicrobial resistance",
        "content": "Antimicrobial resistance Key facts Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats. It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths (1) . The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected. AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. In addition to death and disability, AMR has significant economic costs. The World Bank estimates that AMR could result in US$ 1 trillion additional healthcare costs by 2050, and US$ 1 trillion to US$ 3.4 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) losses per year by 2030 (2) . Priorities to address AMR in human health include preventing all infections, which may result in inappropriate use of antimicrobials; ensuring universal access to quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; and strategic information and innovation, for example surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption/use, and research and development for novel vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. Overview Antimicrobials – including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics – are medicines used to prevent and treat infectious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death. AMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control infections in humans, animals and plants. A global concern Antimicrobial medicines are the cornerstone of modern medicine. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens threatens our ability to treat common infections and to perform life-saving procedures including cancer chemotherapy and caesarean section, hip replacements, organ transplantation and other surgeries. In addition, drug-resistant infections impact the health of animals and plants, reduce productivity in farms, and threaten food security. AMR has significant costs for both health systems and national economies overall. For example, it creates need for more expensive and intensive care, affects productivity of patients or their caregivers through prolonged hospital stays, and harms agricultural productivity. AMR is a problem for all countries at all income levels. Its spread does not recognize country borders. Contributing factors include lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and control in homes, healthcare facilities and farms; poor access to quality and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and medicines; lack of awareness and knowledge; and lack of enforcement of relevant legislation. People living in low-resource settings and vulnerable populations are especially impacted by both the drivers and consequences of AMR. What is the present situation? Drug-resistance in bacteria The global rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the efficacy of common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. The 2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report highlights alarming resistance rates among prevalent bacterial pathogens. Median reported rates in 76 countries of 42% for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and 35% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a major concern. For urinary tract infections caused by E. coli , 1 in 5 cases exhibited reduced susceptibility to standard antibiotics like ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones in 2020. This is making it harder to effectively treat common infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae , a common intestinal bacterium, also showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics. Increased levels of resistance potentially lead to heightened utilization of last-resort drugs like carbapenems, for which resistance is in turn being observed across multiple regions. As the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs is compromised, the risks increase of infections that cannot be treated. Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate an anticipated twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide. Drug resistance in fungi As drug-resistant fungal infections increase, WHO is monitoring their magnitude and public health impact. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat, including due to drug-drug interactions for patients with other infections (e.g. HIV). The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant Candida auris , an invasive fungal infection, is of particular concern. Development of WHO’s Fungal Priority Pathogens List (see below) included a comprehensive review of fungal infections and drug-resistant fungi globally. Drug resistance in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is caused by changes in the HIV genome that affect the ability of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to block the replication of the virus. HIVDR can either be transmitted at the time of infection or acquired because of inadequate adherence to treatment or drug-drug interactions. HIVDR can lead to increased HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends that countries routinely implement HIVDR surveys to inform the selection of optimal ARV drug regimens for HIV prevention and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs, but these medicines are expensive and toxic, and in some cases more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options. MDR-TB is therefore a public health crisis and threat to health security. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022. The emergence of drug-resistant parasites is a major threat to malaria control. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and are used by most malaria endemic countries. Emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin and/or partner drugs in ACTs makes selecting the right treatment more challenging and requires close monitoring. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, partial resistance to artemisinin or a partner drug has been confirmed in several countries since 2001. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, resistance to a partner drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, led in some countries to treatment failure requiring a change to another ACT. In Africa, mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance have been observed in several countries. ACTs that have been tested remain efficacious, but further spread of resistance could be a major public health challenge and improved surveillance is vital. Drug resistance in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) The emergence of drug resistance against medicines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a significant threat to programmes to control, eliminate and eradicate NTDs, which especially affect vulnerable and marginalized populations. Resistance has been reported in leprosy medicines (dapsone, rifampicine and clofazimine) in several countries, in several anti-helminthics (while resistance has so far only been observed in use in animals, which is a serious concern for the veterinary sector, some of these medicines are also used in humans), in medicines used to treat human African trypanosomiasis (melarsoprol) and leishmaniasis (pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine), and others. It is important to monitor resistance and drug efficacy, put in place strategies to delay or curb resistance, and strengthen the pipeline of second-line medicines for NTDs. For example, WHO provides guidance for surveillance of resistance for the global leprosy elimination programme, and support to control distribution and monitor the standardized use, safety and efficacy of medicines, including donated medicines, in NTD programmes. Coordinated global action to address AMR One Health approach AMR is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors. One Health refers to an integrated, unifying approach that aims to achieve optimal and sustainable health outcomes for people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment are closely linked and inter-dependent. The One Health approach to preventing and controlling AMR brings together stakeholders from relevant sectors to communicate and work together in the design, implementation and monitoring of programmes, policies, legislation and research to mitigate AMR and attain better health and economic outcomes. Global Action Plan (GAP) on Antimicrobial Resistance To address AMR globally, countries adopted the Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR during the 2015 World Health Assembly and committed to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans with a One Health approach to tackle AMR. The GAP was subsequently endorsed by the Governing Bodies of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly known as OIE) and the United Nations Environment Program. Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on Antimicrobial Resistance To coordinate the One Health global response to AMR, WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The 4 organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH) are known as the Quadripartite. A quadripartite joint secretariat is hosted by WHO to drive multi-stakeholder engagement in AMR. This has supported establishment of the Global Leaders Group on AMR , which began its work in November 2020, and the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform , which was launched in November 2022, and several technical working groups. High-level meetings on AMR In March 2022, United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/76/257 established a second High-level Meeting on AMR to be held in 2024, in collaboration with the Quadripartite Organizations and with the support of the Global Leaders Group. In October 2023, The President of the General Assembly appointed the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Malta to co-facilitate the high-level meeting. The high-level meeting is an important opportunity for countries to make ambitious commitments and agree targets, and the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat is working closely with the co-facilitators and Global Leaders Group to ensure optimal participation and inputs from the human, animal, agri-food and the environment sectors. In addition, three Global High-level Ministerial Conferences on AMR, in the Netherlands in 2014 and 2019, and in Oman in 2022, led to the Global Action Plan, the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund , and groundbreaking multisectoral AMR targets. A fourth high-level ministerial conference will be hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2024. World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) is a global campaign to raise awareness, understanding and best practices with the public, One Health stakeholders, and other policymakers. One of WHO’s official health campaigns since 2015, WAAW is celebrated from 18 to 24 November every year. A programmatic response to AMR in countries AMR national action plans As of November 2023, 178 countries had developed AMR national action plans aligned with the GAP. To ensure sustained progress, countries need to establish a functioning multisectoral AMR governance mechanism, prioritize activities, develop a costed operational plan, mobilize resources (both domestic and external), and effectively implement their plan. Monitoring mechanisms are needed to track progress, identify challenges and report periodically. To globally track the progress in AMR national action plan implementation, countries have committed to completing the multisectoral annual Tracking AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS) that was launched in 2016 with results published at https://www.amrcountryprogress.org/ . The people-centred approach and WHO core package of interventions To address AMR in a programmatic manner that puts people, their needs and equitable access to health services at the centre of the AMR response in the community, in primary care, secondary and tertiary care, and at national and/or subnational level, WHO has developed the People-centred approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance in human health and WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans. This focuses on preventing infections and ensuring universal access to health services for quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment. As a crucial part of their AMR response, countries can integrate the core package of AMR interventions in national plans and strategies for universal health coverage and health emergency preparedness and response. Antimicrobial stewardship and AWaRe Antimicrobial stewardship is a systematic approach to educate and support health care professionals to follow evidence-based guidelines for prescribing and administering antimicrobials. The education of the health workforce is of crucial importance, as they form the front line in safeguarding the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines. WHO guides countries to develop and implement Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes as one of the most cost-effective interventions to optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines, improve patient outcomes and reduce AMR and health care-associated infections. To improve access to appropriate treatment and reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics, WHO developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics. The WHO AWaRe antibiotic book provides concise, evidence-based guidance on the choice of antibiotic, dose, route of administration, and duration of treatment for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings. Strategic information to inform the AMR response WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) in 2015 to fill knowledge gaps and inform strategies at all levels. GLASS progressively incorporates data from surveillance of AMR in humans, surveillance of the use and consumption of antimicrobials, and integrated AMR data in the One Health sectors including the food chain and in the environment. GLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries, territories and areas. It also monitors the status of existing and new national surveillance systems, with emphasis on representativeness and quality of data collection. Some WHO regions have established surveillance networks that provide technical support to countries and facilitate enrollment into GLASS. WHO is committed especially to supporting low- and middle-income countries to improve data collection and usage for policymaking, both through GLASS and by supporting nationally representative AMR prevalence surveys . Priority-setting for AMR research and product development The clinical pipeline of new antimicrobials is almost dry and there is a pipeline and access crisis for antibiotics. WHO’s latest annual review of the pre-clinical and clinical antibacterial pipelines identified 27 antibiotics in clinical development that address WHO bacterial priority pathogens, of which only 6 were classified as innovative. In addition, a lack of access to quality antimicrobials and shortages of generic off-patent antibiotics affect countries across all levels of income and development. To guide research and development into new antimicrobials, diagnostics and vaccines, and inform public health action, WHO developed the first WHO bacterial priority pathogens list in 2017 and updated this in 2023 (publication forthcoming), and published the WHO fungal priority pathogen list in 2022. To help fill the major gaps in R&D for antimicrobials, vaccines and diagnostic tools, WHO works closely with organizations such as the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP), the AMR Action Fund, and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). Various governments are also piloting different models to incentivize research and development of newer antimicrobials to ultimately ensure access to treatment. Greater innovation and investment are also required in epidemiological and operational research. WHO has outlined 40 priority research topics for AMR in human health and, with the Quadripartite organizations, a One Health priority research agenda for AMR . References 1.

        "content": "Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to human health with significant global economic and security implications. In 2015, WHO Member States unanimously approved a Global Action Plan to tackle AMR (GAP-AMR). The goal of GAP-AMR is “to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them”. Surveillance is an essential tool to inform policies and infection prevention and control responses. Importantly, it is the cornerstone for assessing the spread of AMR and to inform and monitor the impact of local, national and global strategies. On 22 October 2015, WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) , the first global collaborative effort to standardize AMR surveillance. Endorsed by the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in resolution WHA68.7, GLASS was created to support the second objective of the GAP-AMR initiative to “strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research”, and to continue filling knowledge gaps, with the aim to inform strategies at all levels. SCOPE GLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries and seeks to actively support capacity building and monitor the status of existing and new national surveillance systems. Furthermore, GLASS promotes a shift from surveillance approaches based solely on laboratory data to a system that includes epidemiological, clinical, and population-level data . GLASS has been conceived to progressively incorporate data from surveillance of AMR in humans, such as monitoring of resistance and the use of antimicrobial medicines, including AMR in the food chain and in the environment. STRUCTURE The various types of AMR-related surveillance activities led by GLASS are grouped into a series of technical modules . These modules comprise surveillance activities built on routinely-available data (for example, patient samples collected for clinical purposes or national sales of antimicrobials) and focused activities targeted at generating information for specific purposes, based on the needs of countries and regions. GLASS is also engaged in the design and implementation of surveys and studies aimed at helping countries to achieve a better quality and representativeness of their data. Furthermore, GLASS provides support, including evidence-based guidelines and technical documents, to assist countries and regions to build capacity and take appropriate and timely corrective actions. PARTNERSHIPS GLASS works across all three levels of WHO – headquarters and regional and country offices – and is supported by the WHO AMR Surveillance and Quality Assessment Collaborating Centres Network (WHO AMR Surveillance CC Network). It enjoys strong commitment from participating countries and close collaboration with AMR regional networks such as the Central Asian and European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (CAESAR), the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), the Latin American Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (Rede Latinoamericana de Vigilancia de la Resistencia a los Antimicrobianos [ReLAVRA]), and the Western Pacific Regional Antimicrobial Consumption Surveillance System WPRACSS.

GLASS-AMC provides a common and standardized set of methods for measuring and reporting antimicrobial consumption (AMC) at country, regional and global levels. Both technical modules collect data on the implementation of the respective national surveillance systems. FOCUSED SURVEILLANCE GLASS-EAR , the emerging AMR reporting (EAR) module, supports the timely detection, reporting, risk assessment and monitoring of emerging resistance. GLASS-FUNGI focuses on the surveillance of invasive fungal bloodstream infections caused by Candida spp. SURVEYS AND STUDIES EGASP offers an enhanced approach to sentinel gonorrhoea surveillance of men with urethral discharge and suspected urogenital infections. The One Health technical module offers an integrated multi-sector surveillance programme based on the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- Escherichia coli (‘Tricycle’) project.

GLASS IT Tools GLASS IT Platform GLASS IT TOOLS The GLASS IT Platform is a web-based platform for global data sharing on AMR. It serves as a common environment for data submission for several technical modules (GLASS-AMR, GLASS-AMC, GLASS-FUNGI, EGASP) and supports the implementation of One Health AMR surveillance at national level. The GLASS IT Platform is also intended to facilitate future integrated analyses between AMC and AMR data at national, regional and global levels. WHONET GLASS IT TOOLS WHONET is a free desktop Windows application for the management and analysis of microbiology laboratory data, with a particular focus on AMR surveillance, developed and supported by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). WHONET is available in 28 languages and supports local, national, regional, and global surveillance efforts in more than 2300 hospital, public health, animal health and food laboratories in over 130 countries worldwide. Laboratory Strenghthening GLASS and WHO Collaborating Centres are working on building national laboratory capacities in countries through a range of activities. Laboratory-based diagnostic tests for AMR usually involve the laboratory identification of the infectious organism, its drug susceptibility, and sometimes serology testing and molecular analyses. Increased laboratory capacity and rapid, accurate diagnostic testing in countries would significantly impact on global AMR surveillance and diagnostic stewardship. Diagnostic stewardship is defined as including the various stages of the diagnostic process in clinical microbiology and laboratory management. GLASS and WHO Collaborating Centres will provide technical support to countries for the development and operation of national reference laboratories, such as external quality assurance, quality management, continuous training for the performance of AMR testing, as well as for the reporting and interpretation of AMR results. Several tools are listed below to support laboratory functions. Additional tools are currently under development by GLASS to support the strengthening of national reference laboratories in resource-limited settings. GLASS Partnerships CAESAR CAESAR is a joint initiative of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). It consists of a network of national AMR surveillance systems coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm (Sweden) and includes all countries of the WHO European Region that are not part of EARS-Net. EARS-Net EARS-Net is the largest publicly-funded system for AMR surveillance in Europe. It is managed and coordinated by ECDC, supported by a coordination committee composed of experts selected from the appointed disease-specific contact points. EARS-Net is based on routine clinical antimicrobial susceptibility data from local and clinical laboratories reported to ECDC by appointed representatives from WHO Member States. Data originate from national AMR surveillance initiatives and/or laboratory networks. Only data from invasive isolates (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) are included. ReLAVRA In 1996, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO launched ReLAVRA, the Latin American Network for AMR Surveillance, which aims at reporting the magnitude and trends of AMR in the region using routine data from microbiology laboratories. WPRACSS WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) launched the Western Pacific Regional Antimicrobial Surveillance System (WPRACSS) in 2020 to support its Member States in the implementation and further development of antimicrobial consumption and use monitoring at national level, in hospitals and the community, and to provide a regional platform for countries to understand their own consumption patterns to help guide action on stewardship and surveillance. WPRACSS aims to conduct AMC monitoring across the WPR with the aim of increasing multi-stakeholder accountability and strengthening stewardship of antimicrobials and improving health outcomes. EURO AMC Network In collaboration with partners, the AMC Network was established in 2011 to assist non-EU countries and areas in setting up or strengthening surveillance at country/area level. Monitoring of consumption at country/area level helps provide centralized data to ensure that strategies to address antimicrobial consumption and resistance are effective. Efforts are closely coordinated with the ECDC so that data are comparable and can provide a pan-European overview of trends. WHO AMR Surveillance CC Network The mission of the AMR Surveillance CC Network is to assist WHO in supporting countries to build the capacity to develop and implement AMR surveillance.
