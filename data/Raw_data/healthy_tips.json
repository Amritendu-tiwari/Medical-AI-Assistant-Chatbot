Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. This page includes a few quick and easy tips on how to make healthy dietary choices. Background Good nutrition is about consistently choosing healthy foods and beverages. Healthy eating patterns can include foods and beverages that reflect preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations . Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Dairy recommendations include low-fat or fat-free milk, lactose-free milk, and fortified soy beverages. Other plant-based beverages do not have the same nutritional properties as animal's milk and soy beverages. Protein recommendations include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), soy products, nuts, and seeds. Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started. Bump up fiber Fiber helps maintain digestive health and helps us feel fuller longer. Fiber also helps control blood sugar and lowers cholesterol levels. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds are good sources of fiber. To bump up fiber, try this: Slice raw vegetables for quick snacks. Start your day with a whole-grain cereal, like oatmeal. Foods made with bulgur or quinoa are also high in fiber. Top your cereal with berries, pumpkin seeds, or almonds. A half-cup of beans or lentils on a salad can add texture and flavor. Enjoy fresh fruit with a meal or as dessert. Increase calcium and vitamin D Calcium and vitamin D work together to promote optimal bone health. Our bodies can make vitamin D from sunshine. However, some people may have a hard time producing enough vitamin D. And too much sun exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. Foods and beverages are often fortified with this essential nutrient. See food sources of calcium and vitamin D . To increase calcium and vitamin D intake, try this: Drink a fortified dairy beverage with your meals. Add sardines to your lunch once a week. Canned salmon is another great option. Sardines and salmon with bones have more calcium than these products without bones. Canned salmon is another great option.

        "content": "Nutrition Facts Label and Your Health Key points The Nutrition Facts Label on packaged foods is based on dietary recommendations for Americans. Read the label on your packaged food and drinks to track sugars, fats, protein, and other nutrients. Using the label can help you choose foods for a healthy diet. Overview The Nutrition Facts Label on packaged foods is based on dietary recommendations for Americans. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates what goes on the Nutrition Facts Label. Below are explanations of parts of the label and some tips for using it to follow healthy eating patterns. Serving size The serving size reflects what people are likely to eat or drink. This is not necessarily the portion you should eat. For example, one serving size of ice cream is labeled as ⅔ cup. A 12–ounce or 20–ounce bottle of soda is labeled as one serving. Be sure you know how many servings are in packaged food. For example, if you buy what looks like an individual sized chicken pie, check the Nutrition Facts Label. It might actually be two servings. with double the calories and sodium of a single serving. Dual Column Labels Some food and drink packages that contain more than one serving may have a dual column Nutrition Facts Label. In that case, one column on the Nutrition Facts Label may provide calorie and nutrition information for one serving. Another column may provide calorie and nutrition information for the whole package. Calories and fat Larger, darker letters make calories the easiest item to see. When it comes to health outcomes, the type of fat you eat matters more than the overall amount of fat. The Nutrition Facts Label shows total fat in grams and percentages of calories from fat. The Nutrition Facts Label has separate lines for saturated and trans fats, which are less healthy than other types of fat. Look for foods with very little saturated and trans fats. Sodium The recommended daily limit for sodium is 2,300 milligrams. The Nutrition Facts Label indicates the number of milligrams of sodium in a serving. Most sodium we consume is from salt, which is a common ingredient in processed foods. Read the Nutrition Facts Labels and choose the product with less sodium. Added Sugars The Nutrition Facts Label shows the percentage of calories from added sugars. Naturally occurring sugars, such as those in fruit or milk, are not added sugars. Added sugars include brown sugar, maple sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, and molasses. The two main sources of added sugars in the United States are sugary drinks and desserts/sweet snacks. Keep your intake of added sugars to less than 10% of your total daily calories. That means if you consume 2,000 calories in a day, added sugars should account for no more than 200 calories. If you eat even one large dessert or sugary drink per day, you are likely getting more than the recommended daily limit of added sugar. Try drinking plain water instead of sugary drinks and limiting the serving size of treats. See how to Rethink Your Drink and Be Sugar Smart .

Why it matters Good nutrition is important for young children to help them grow healthy and strong. Children need a variety of nutritious foods each day for healthy growth and brain development. Early eating experiences can also affect how people eat as they get older. This is why it is important to introduce young children to healthy foods, including a variety of fruits and vegetables. Follow these tips to help your picky eater try new foods. Try different approaches Try eating the food first to show them you like it. Then, let them try it. Make funny faces with the foods on their plate. It may help them get excited to eat it. Give them a choice of different foods to try. Let them decide which one to try today. Serve new foods with foods you know they like. Try freezing small bites of leftover foods. You can use these later and avoid throwing food away. Wait a couple of days before offering the food again. It can take more than 10 times before your child likes it. As children get older, they may start refusing foods they used to like or start showing signs of being a picky eater. Favoring just a couple of foods or not wanting foods to touch each other on the plate are normal behaviors. These behaviors often go away by the time the child is about 5 years old. Children may need to try some foods many times. Children may not like every food you give them on the first try. Give them a chance to try foods again and again, even if they don't like them at first. Children may need to try some foods many times before they like them. Try a variety of tastes and textures Giving your child foods with a variety of different tastes and textures can help them learn to accept and like a variety of foods. You can let your child try a variety of textures including: Smooth (strained or pureed). Mashed or lumpy. Finely chopped or ground. Start with smooth or mashed foods first and then move towards finely chopped or ground foods as they get older. This can help your child develop chewing skills, as well as fine motor skills like pinching and picking up food with their fingers. Be sure to offer foods in the right size, consistency, and shape for your child's age and development to help prevent choking. Keep it fun! Try these playful activities to keep your picky eater engaged and open to new tastes and textures. Even the youngest can help by washing and sorting foods. Encourage your child to use 3 of their 5 senses (smell, touch, taste) as you prepare food. Prepare the same fruit or vegetable in different ways. Developed with the CDC Foundation.

        "content": "Tips for Reducing Sodium Intake Key points Eating too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most sodium in our diets comes from packaged and restaurant food, not the salt shaker. You can reduce sodium intake by following the tips below at the grocery store, at home, and in restaurants. Why it's important Eating too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for heart disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause. Even foods that may not taste salty can be major sources of sodium. Foods with only moderate amounts of sodium, such as bread, can be major sources of sodium because they’re eaten so frequently. At the grocery store Buy fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables with no salt or sauce added. Choose packaged foods labeled \"low sodium,\" \"reduced sodium,\" or \"no salt added\" when available. Compare the amount of sodium in different products by reading Nutrition Facts labels . Check the amount of sodium per serving and the number of servings per container. Choose the options with the lowest amounts of sodium. When possible, purchase fresh poultry, fish, pork, and lean meat, rather than cured, salted, smoked, and other processed meats. For fresh items, check to see whether saline or salt solution has been added—if so, choose another brand. Ask your grocer if they have a low sodium shopping list available. Tip‎ At home When cooking, replace or reduce the amount of salt you use. Alternatives could be garlic, citrus juice, salt-free seasonings, or spices. Prepare rice, pasta, beans, and meats from their most basic forms (dry and fresh) when possible. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Limit sauces, mixes, and instant products, including flavored rice and ready-made pasta. At restaurants Ask for nutrition information before you order, and select a lower sodium meal. Ask that no salt be added to your meal. Order vegetables with no salt added or fruit as a side item. Split a meal with a friend or family member. Keep takeout and fast food to an occasional treat. Choose a heart-healthy diet The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan is a simple, heart-healthy diet that can help prevent or lower high blood pressure. The DASH diet is low in sodium, cholesterol, and saturated and total fats. The diet is high in fruits and vegetables, fiber, potassium, and low-fat dairy products."

        "content": "About Nutrition Key points Good nutrition is essential to keep current and future generations of Americans healthy across the lifespan. Poor nutrition affects our economy. CDC works with communities, states, national groups, and global partners to improve nutrition. Why it matters Good nutrition is essential across life stages, from infant and child growth and brain development to healthy and safer pregnancies and healthy aging. Micronutrients, often referred to as vitamins and minerals, are vital to healthy development, growth, disease prevention, and well-being. Here are six essential micronutrients and why they are important to our health. Breastfeeding helps protect against childhood illnesses. Such illnesses include ear and severe lower respiratory infections, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Low levels of certain vitamins and minerals can result in mental impairment and central nervous system defects in infants. Most mothers start out breastfeeding, but about 6 in 10 stop sooner than they planned. Low rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to medical costs for women and children in the United States. Adults with healthy eating patterns live longer and are at lower risk for serious, costly health problems. Examples include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. What CDC is doing CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) works with three state and local programs to ensure access to good nutrition for all people: State Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) High Obesity Program (HOP) Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Through the International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control Program , we help improve vitamin and mineral nutrition in the United States and globally. We also collaborate with the Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN). DNPAO created NOPREN to foster understanding of effective policies to prevent obesity. Prevention efforts of focus are improved access to affordable, healthier foods and beverages in childcare, schools, worksite, and other community settings. Priorities We encourage state and local organizations to implement policies and activities to: Promote food service and nutrition guidelines where food is sold, served, and distributed. Coordinate the uptake of and expansion of existing voucher incentive and produce prescription programs . Achieve continuity of care for those who breastfeed . Improve nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding in early care and education settings. Milestones In the United States, the percentage of births in hospitals with recommended maternity care practices to support breastfeeding increased from 3.8% in 2010 to 28.9% in 2021. Many states require licensed childcare programs to follow science-based infant feeding and nutrition standards. This affects the meals and snacks of millions of young children. In 2023, more than 6,100 schools obtained and offered salad bars. This increased healthy fruit and vegetable options for more than 3.5 million children and school staff. Iodine is added to more prenatal vitamins for pregnant and breastfeeding women to support the infant's growth and cognitive development.

Infants, children, adolescent girls, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women are the most likely groups to have deficiencies. CDC is working in the United States to improve micronutrient intake. The problem Micronutrient deficiencies can have significant consequences on our health and well-being, yet: Approximately 1 in 4 U.S. women has iron deficiency during pregnancy. Approximately 1 in 8 U.S. women aged 12 to 49 has iron deficiency. More than half of children younger than 5 worldwide suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Learn More You can learn more about the six essential micronutrients and their roles in healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being. What CDC is doing Through the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO), CDC works to: Identify and monitor iodine, iron, and anemia levels among groups at risk for deficiencies. Provide practical strategies for feeding healthy foods and drinks to infants and toddlers. Work with partners to engage pediatricians in advising on the importance of good nutrition practices for young children. Help public health partners: Develop guidelines on vitamin and mineral interventions as well as assess anemia and micronutrient status. Design, monitor, and evaluate interventions such as mass food fortification, home fortification, and micronutrient supplementation. Build laboratory capacity for vitamin and mineral biomarker monitoring. This is in collaboration with the Nutritional Biomarkers Branch in CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences.

Follow the links for background information, potential activities, examples of what others are doing, and resources. Make healthy food choices easier everywhere Improving nutrition throughout the lifespan helps reduce the risk of chronic disease. Two ways states and communities can help make healthy food choices easier everywhere are to: Promote food service and nutrition guidelines where food is sold, served, or distributed. Expand fruit and vegetable voucher incentive and produce prescription programs. Make breastfeeding easier to start and continue Supporting breastfeeding where mothers give birth, live, work, play, and raise children makes it easier for families to initiate and continue breastfeeding. It can help eliminate disparities in breastfeeding rates. See policies and activities that can help achieve continuity of care . Strengthen obesity prevention in ECE settings Promoting healthy foods and breastfeeding support, along with increasing physical activity and limiting screen time, in early care and education (ECE) settings can affect millions of children. States and communities can support children’s healthy growth and development in ECE at three levels: state systems, programs, and providers. Increase access to Family Healthy Weight Programs Family Healthy Weight Programs support healthy growth for children with obesity and their families. These programs help participants incorporate healthy eating, stress reduction, optimal sleep, and increased physical activity into their daily behaviors. Resources"

Drinking water can prevent dehydration and helps the body function normally. See tips for drinking more water throughout the day. Benefits of drinking water Getting enough water every day is important for health. Drinking water can prevent dehydration, which may cause unclear thinking, mood change, overheating, constipation, and kidney stones. Water has no calories, so replacing sugary drinks with plain water can help reduce caloric intake. Water helps your body: Keep a normal temperature. Lubricate and cushion joints. Protect your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues. Get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements. Your body needs more water when you are: In hot climates. More physically active. Running a fever. Having diarrhea or vomiting. Meeting your water intake every day Daily water intake recommendations vary by age, sex, pregnancy status, activity level, and breastfeeding status. Daily water intake is mostly from water and other beverages. Foods, especially those with high water content such as many fruits and vegetables, can also add to fluid intake. Tips to drink more water Carry a reusable water bottle with you. Freeze water in freezer-safe bottles for ice-cold water all day. Choose water over sugary drinks. Opt for water when eating out. Serve water during meals. Add a wedge of lime or lemon to your water. Healthier drink options Many other beverages can be part of healthy eating patterns. Low- or no- calorie beverages Plain coffee or teas, sparkling water, seltzers, and flavored waters are low-calorie choices. Drinks with important nutrients Low-fat or fat-free milk; unsweetened, fortified milk alternatives; and 100% fruit or vegetable juice contain important nutrients. Enjoy these drinks within recommended calorie limits. Other beverages Sugary drinks: Regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters, and sweetened coffee and tea contain calories but little nutritional value . Learn how to Rethink Your Drink . Alcoholic drinks : If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Caffeinated drinks: Moderate caffeine consumption (up to 400 mg per day) can be a part of a healthy diet . That's about 3 to 5 cups of plain coffee. Drinks with sugar alternatives: Drinks that are labeled \"sugar-free\" or \"diet\" likely contain high-intensity sweeteners, such as sucralose, aspartame, or saccharine. These sweeteners may reduce caloric intake in the short term. However, there are many questions about the sweeteners' effectiveness for long-term weight management. Energy drinks: In addition to added sugar, these products may also contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants. Concerns have been raised about the potential health risks of these products, especially for young people.

        "content": "Tips for Healthy Eating for a Healthy Weight Key points An eating plan that helps promote health and manage weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Comfort foods, in limited amounts, can be part of healthy eating patterns. Why it's important People with healthy eating patterns live longer and are at lower risk for serious health problems such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. For people with chronic diseases, healthy eating can help manage these conditions and prevent complications. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 , a healthy eating plan: Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. Includes a variety of protein foods. Healthful options include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), soy products, nuts, and seeds. Is low in added sugars , sodium (salt) , saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Stays within your daily calorie needs . USDA's MyPlate Plan can identify what to eat, how much to eat from the different food groups, and how to stay within your recommended calorie allowance. My Food Diary can help you track meals and snacks. Keep reading for specific tips for fruit, vegetables, calcium-rich foods, meat, and comfort food. Fruit Fresh, frozen, or canned fruits are great choices. Try fruits beyond apples and bananas, such as mangos, pineapples, or kiwis. When fresh fruit is not in season, try a frozen, canned, or dried variety. Be aware that dried and canned fruit may contain added sugars or syrups. Choose canned varieties of fruit packed in water or in its own juice. Vegetables Add variety to grilled or steamed vegetables with an herb such as rosemary. You can also sauté (pan-fry) vegetables in a non-stick pan with a small amount of cooking spray. Or try frozen or canned vegetables for a quick side dish—just microwave and serve. Frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions can give stews and omelets a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients. Look for frozen and canned vegetables without added salt, butter, or cream sauces. Calcium-rich foods In addition to fat-free and low-fat milk, consider low-fat and fat-free yogurts without added sugars. These come in a variety of flavors and can be a great dessert substitute. Fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon are also good sources of calcium . Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption. Sources of vitamin D can include: Fortified drinks such as milk and fortified soy beverages. Fortified foods such as yogurt or some cereals. Some seafoods. Meats If your favorite recipe calls for frying fish or breading chicken, try healthier variations by baking or grilling. Maybe even try dry beans in place of meats. Ask friends or search the internet and magazines for recipes with fewer calories. You might be surprised to find you have a new favorite dish! Comfort foods You can still enjoy your favorite foods, even if they are high in calories, fat, or added sugars. The key is eating them only once in a while. Some general tips for comfort foods: Eat them less often. If you normally eat these foods every day, cut back to once a week or once a month. Eat smaller amounts. If your favorite higher-calorie food is a chocolate bar, have a smaller size or only half a bar. Try a lower-calorie version . Use lower-calorie ingredients or prepare food differently. For example, a macaroni and cheese recipe might include whole milk, butter, and full-fat cheese. You can try remaking it with non-fat milk, less butter, low-fat cheese, fresh spinach, and tomatoes. Remember to not increase your portion size.

        "content": "Steps for Losing Weight Key points If you want to lose weight, making a specific plan can help. Healthy weight loss includes a lifestyle with healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, enough sleep, and stress management. The five steps on this page can help you get started. Overview A lifestyle with good nutrition, regular physical activity, stress management, and enough sleep supports a healthy weight. People who lose weight at a gradual, steady pace—about 1 to 2 pounds a week—are more likely to keep the weight off than people who lose weight quicker. Factors, such as medicines, medical conditions, stress, genes, hormones, environment, and age can also affect weight management . If you're concerned about your weight or have questions about your medications, talk with your health care provider. When you are ready to get started, explore these five steps to guide you to a healthier weight. Step 1: Understand your \"why\" Consider why you want to lose weight, whether it's because heart disease runs in your family or you want to be more physically active. Writing down your reasons will help you stay focused on your goal. Place your reasons where you can see them daily to remind yourself why you want to make this change. Even modest weight loss helps If you are not at a healthy weight, even modest weight loss can help improve your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. For example, a 5% weight reduction for a person who weighs 200 pounds is 10 pounds. This change could lower the risk for some chronic diseases such as heart disease, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Step 2: Track where you are Tracking where you are now helps to identify how you want to improve your health. You can start by tracking your nutrition, physical activity, and sleep. Write down or use an app to track: Nutrition: Include everything you consume for a few days in a food and beverage diary . This will help you see what you eat and drink and consider how to make small changes. Physical activity: Include time of day, what activity you did, and duration in a physical activity diary . Sleep : Include the hours of sleep you get. The amount you need changes as you age. Stress: Include healthy ways you are reducing your stress . Other wellness factors you can track include how you are feeling when you eat and drink and are active, and lifestyle challenges. To track lifestyle challenges, you can ask yourself questions like the ones included in the table below. If you answer yes, consider ways to overcome those challenges. Lifestyle challenge Consideration to overcome challenge Does your work schedule make it hard to be physically active? Walk to work or take public transportation. Take walk breaks at work. Ask a coworker to join you for a walk at lunch or after work. Do you eat sugary foods because that's what you buy for your kids? Have fruits and vegetables on hand to quickly grab. Bring the family together to create healthier changes for everyone at home. Plan meals ahead of time. Do your coworkers bring in treats to share? Bring healthier snacks to share with your coworkers. Start a wellness committee at work to promote healthier eating among your coworkers. Meet with human resources to discuss having the workplace offer healthier options. Do you feel tired because you are not getting enough sleep? Set regular bed and wake times. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening. Turn off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime. Step 3: Set specific goals you can reach in a realistic time Set short-term goals and reward your efforts along the way. Short-term goals might include drinking water instead of sugary beverages, taking a 15-minute evening walk, or having a vegetable with supper. Focus on two or three goals at a time. Effective goals are specific and realistic. For example, \"exercise more\" is not specific. But \"I will walk 15 minutes, 3 days a week for the first week,\" is specific and potentially more realistic. Setting unrealistic goals, such as losing 20 pounds in 2 weeks, can leave you feeling defeated and frustrated. Remember, occasional setbacks happen. This is expected. When they happen, get back on track as quickly as possible. Then, think about how to prevent setbacks in similar future situations. Everyone is different. What works for someone else might not be right for you. For example, to help you be more active, try a variety of physical activities, such as walking, swimming, tennis, or group exercise classes. See what you enjoy most and can fit into your life. These activities will be easier to stick with over the long term. Step 4: Find support Identify family members or friends who will support your weight loss efforts. Coworkers or neighbors with similar goals might share healthy recipes and plan group physical activities. It may help to join a weight-loss program or visit a health care professional, such as a nutrition or weight-loss specialist. Ask for a follow-up appointment to monitor changes in your weight and any related health conditions. You can also ask your health care provider for resources to support a healthy weight. This may include referral to a registered dietitian, clinical or community programs, federally approved medications or devices, or weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. Establishing healthy habits are very difficult when healthy choices are limited. Consider looking up your local community resources, such as food pantries, farmers markets, parks and recreation, and trails. Food assistance and food systems resources Resources for food assistance in everyday situations, as well as before, during, and after emergencies and disasters. These resources are for individuals and organizations. Step 5: Monitor your progress Evaluate your progress regularly by revisiting your goals. Decide which parts of your plan are working well and which parts need to be changed. Use this information to revise your goals and plan. If you consistently meet a particular goal, add a new goal to help continue your pathway to success. Reward yourself for your achievements! Recognize when you're meeting your goals and be proud of your progress. Use non-food rewards, such as a bouquet of fresh flowers, a sports outing with friends, or a relaxing bath. Rewards help keep you motivated on the path to better health. Resources Treatment for overweight and obesity Health care professionals can help you adopt lifestyle changes that may help you lose excess weight safely and keep it off over the long term. Choosing a safe and successful weight-loss program How to choose a program that may help you lose weight safely and keep it off over time.
