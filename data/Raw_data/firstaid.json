        "content": "Medical portal First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with a medical emergency , [ 1 ] with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical or first response training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, [ 2 ] while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD . [ 3 ] Conflict first aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual's social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada . There are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance, which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator ), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. Generally, five steps are associated with first aid: Assess the surrounding areas. Move to a safe surrounding (if not already; for example, road accidents are unsafe to be dealt with on roads). Call for help: both professional medical help and people nearby who might help in first aid such as the compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Perform suitable first aid depending on the injury suffered by the casualty. Evaluate the casualty for any fatal signs of danger, or possibility of performing the first aid again. Early history and warfare Skills of what is now known as first aid have been recorded throughout history, especially in relation to warfare , where the care of both traumatic and medical cases is required in particularly large numbers. The bandaging of battle wounds is shown on Classical Greek pottery from c. 500 BC , whilst the parable of the Good Samaritan includes references to binding or dressing wounds. [ 4 ] There are numerous references to first aid performed within the Roman army , with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals. [ 5 ] Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern combat medic . [ 6 ] Further examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the Holy Land . [ 7 ] Formalization of life saving treatments During the late 18th century, drowning as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in Amsterdam , and in 1773, physician William Hawes began publicizing the power of artificial respiration as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned. This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned , later the Royal Humane Society , who did much to promote resuscitation. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Napoleon 's surgeon, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey , is credited with creating an ambulance corps, the ambulance volantes , which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle. [ 10 ] In 1859, Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino , and his work led to the formation of the Red Cross , with a key stated aim of \"aid to sick and wounded soldiers in the field\". [ 7 ] The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide. [ 11 ] In 1870, Prussian military surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term \"erste hilfe\" (translating to 'first aid'), including training for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the Esmarch bandage which he designed. [ 4 ] The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses. In 1872, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England changed its focus from hospice care, and set out to start a system of practical medical help, starting with making a grant towards the establishment of the UK's first ambulance service. This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day St John Ambulance ) \"to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded\". [ 12 ] Also in the UK, Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd had seen the advantages of von Esmarch's new teaching of first aid, and introduced an equivalent programme for the British Army, and so being the first user of \"first aid for the injured\" in English, disseminating information through a series of lectures. Following this, in 1878, Shepherd and Colonel Francis Duncan took advantage of the newly charitable focus of St John, [ 4 ] and established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians. The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum. First aid training began to spread through the British Empire through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways. [ 13 ] The first recorded first aid training in the United States took place in Jermyn, Pennsylvania in 1899. [ 14 ] Common emergences that require first aid in humans List of common situations that require first aid, and information about them (in alphabetical order): Bleeding Bleeding or hemorrhage is the escape of blood from veins or arteries. Cardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat) Cardiac arrest is the complete stop of heart function. Choking Choking is the obstruction of breathing caused by a blockage in the respiratory tract. Diabetes, hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia or hyperglycaemia is a condition in which an excessive level of glucose is present in the blood. Diabetes, hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia or hypoglycaemia is a condition in which an excessively low level of glucose is present in the blood. It typically occurs due to complications with medication used to reduce blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Drowning Drowning in humans is a type of suffocation caused by both the nose and mouth being submerged in liquid. The first aid for drowning is very similar to that of cardiorespiratory arrest. Infarction of the heart A myocardial infarction , commonly known as a heart attack , is the sudden reduction in or lack of blood flow in one of the coronary arteries in the heart, causing infarction (tissue death due to inadequate blood supply). Risk factors for myocardial infarctions include living a sedentary lifestyle, age (being over 45 for men and 55 for women), tobacco and alcohol use, stress, obesity, high cholesterol, family history, and diabetes. [ 15 ] Stroke A stroke is a sudden lack of blood supply to the brain caused by a burst or blocked artery. [ 16 ] Aims of first aid The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of 'the three Ps': [ 17 ] Preserve life: The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death. First aid done correctly should help reduce the patient's level of pain and calm them down during the evaluation and treatment process. Prevent further harm: Prevention of further harm includes addressing both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed from becoming dangerous. Promote recovery: First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound. First aid is not medical treatment, and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person. Setting the priorities A first aid intervention would follow an order, which would try to attend in the best manner the main threats for the life and mobility of the victim. There are some first aid protocols (such as ATLS, BATLS and SAFE-POINT) that define which are the priorities and the correct execution of the steps for saving human life. A major benefit of the use of official protocols is that they require minimum resources, time and skills, and have a great degree of success. ABCDE and csABCDE general protocol The ABCDE method is the general protocol of first aid and implies a quite general view. [ 18 ] It was initially developed by Dr Peter Safar in the 1950s. But it has received some modifications, improvements and variations that were intended for more specific contexts. For example: it has been completed with improvements from the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the American College of Surgeons [ 19 ] and the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the British Army. [ 20 ] As a result, the mnemonic of the steps of this protocol is ABCDE , or its improved version (cs)ABCDE (sometimes called xABCDE , the words in the mnemonic may vary), which represent: [ 21 ] [ 22 ] —An attached first part (named as \"cs\" or \"x\", or in any other way) that will always mention stopping the critical losses of blood and managing with a special and careful treatment to patients with serious damages at the spine that threaten their future mobility: catastrophic-bleeding (stopping urgently the massive external bleedings, as it is marked in the BATLS version). spine-protection (previous examination of the spine, and careful preventive treatment for its damages, as it is marked in the ATLS version). —The ABCDE protocol itself: Airway (clearing airways). Breathing (ensuring respiration). Circulation (ensuring effective cardiac output). Any Defibrillation process for a cardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat) would be included here, or in 'Disability' (as a double mnemonic 'D'). Disability (neurological condition, level of glucose can also be examined). Exposure (or 'Evaluate': other questions in an overall examination of the patient, environment). ABC and CABD cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol This protocol (originally named as ABC ) is a simplified version or concrete application of the previous csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, that focuses in the use of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation . The American Heart Association and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation teach it as a reference. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Its current mnemonic is CABD (an improvement in the sequence for most of the cases): Circulation or Chest Compressions. Airway : attempt to open the airway (using a head-tilt and chin-lift technique; not in the case of babies, which require avoid tilting the head). Breathing or Rescue Breaths . Defibrillation : use of an automated external defibrillator to recover heart function. Wider protocols These are the protocols that do not only deal with direct care to the victim but they also mention other complementary tasks (before and later). This method has been studied and employed for a long time in many European countries, as France. [ 25 ] It is a reference, of a certain reputation, that could be applied solely or to a certain degree, usually combining it with the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method or its simplified CABD (ABC) variant about cardio-pulmonary resuscitation . The European method has a wider range than them, and their steps include tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves. These are its steps (with no official mnemonic that helps to remember them): Protection for patients and rescuers. If dangers are present, the patient would be moved to a safer place with a careful management of any detected spinal injury. Evaluation of the patient (looking for priorities as critical bleeding and cardiac arrest). Alerting to medical services and bystanders. Performing the first aid practices. The CABD (or ABC) method for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and many details of the wider csABCDE (or ABCDE) method would be included in this step. Other mentionable protocols Some other known protocols that could be mentioned in many contexts (in alphabetical order): AMEGA protocol It is similar to the European protocol, because it also has a wider range [ 26 ] than the common csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, and includes other tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves. The order of the steps is changed, and the experience with it is lesser, but it adds the idea of a posterior 'aftermath' phase. The mnemonic AMEGA refers to: Assess the situation, looking for risks. Make safe the situation, after having identified the risks. Emergency aid . Performing the first aid practices. Get help . Asking for emergency help to medical services and bystanders. Aftermath . The aftermath tasks include recording and reporting, continued care of patients and the welfare of responders and the replacement of used first aid kit elements. ATLS and BATLS protocols They are basically the common ABCDE and csABCDE protocol , but focusing in particular aspects. The ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version [ 19 ] was developed by the American College of Surgeons, focusing in the particular needs of trauma and specifically in the spinal injuries. And the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version [ 20 ] is an improvement for the British Army that added the concept of 'catastrophic bleeding'. The preference for one or another among all these protocols can depend on the context and the audience. It comes from Red Cross [ 27 ] and, as the European protocol, has a wider range than the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method. So it could be seen as a simplification of the European protocol, and, especially, easier to remember as a guide for most of cases. It mentions the following steps: Check the scene for safety of the rescuer and others, and check the patient's condition. Call to emergency medical services. Care the patient. Another European protocol, which appeared in the field of construction of Czech Republic to react to any emergence . [ 28 ] Their steps (which have not any mnemonic) are: Safety of the rescuers. Calling to emergency telephone number. Bleeding : treating the massive bleedings. Freeing the airways . Resuscitation : applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Keeping warm to the patient. Key basic skills Certain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously. Displacement skills If there are dangers around (such as fire, electric dangers or others) the patient has to be moved to a safe place, [ 29 ] [ 30 ] (if it is safe for the first aid provider to do so), where providing the required first aid procedures is possible. — In case of a possible severe spinal injury: when a patient seems to have a possible serious injury in the spinal cord (in the backbone, either at the neck part or the back part), that patient must not be moved except if that is necessary, and, when necessary, it must be done as little as possible and very carefully (see mentions about this type of injury in the gallery of drawings below). These precautions avoid many risks of causing further damages for the patient's mobility in the future. Usually, the patient needs to end up lying down, in a face-up position, on a sufficiently firm surface (for example, on the floor, which allows to perform the chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation). —A victim with a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck), which indicates a risk to the future mobility, can be carefully transferred by several rescuers that work coordinately. The victim’s head and back would be held in the same position they were. —When there is a victim with a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck) and a rescuer without instruments, the rescuer can try to carry the victim carefully through the Rautek maneuver (as in the picture), trying to keep victim’s head and back in the same position they were. The victim's head can be supported on the rescuer to try to soften the movements. A second rescuer can hold the legs. —A victim without a serious injury in the spine (in the back or the neck) can be pulled through the floor, which is easier on a blanket, carpet or another tissue located under most of the body. —Carrying on a base to victims with a suspected spinal injury would require to place them carefully, while keeping their head and back in the same position they were, on a higher or much thicker base (as a litter or mattress), for a better displacement. Checking skills They evaluate the condition of the victim, [ 29 ] first attending to the main threats for life. The preferred initial way of checking consist of asking, commonly by touching the patient in one of his shoulders and shouting something, such as: \"can you hear me?\" In some cases, the victim has a wound that bleeds abundantly, which requires its own additional treatment to stop the blood loss (usually, it would begin by keeping the wound pressed). If the patient does not react, the heartbeats can be checked in the carotid pulse: placing two fingers on any side of the neck (on the left or the right side), near his head. In cases where checking the carotid pulse is impossible, heartbeats can be perceived in the radial pulse: placing two fingers on a wrist, under the part of the thumb, and applying moderate pressure. Breathing can also be checked additionally, placing an ear on the mouth and, at the same time, watching the chest rising by the effect of the air. It is recommended not to waste too much time of first aid in checking (professional rescuers are taught to take 10 seconds in it). Checking of heartbeats in the carotid pulse. This is usually the fastest method of checking the patient's condition. Verification of heartbeats in the radial pulse, pressing moderately on a wrist, under the part of the thumb. Check of patient's breathing, listening the air inside of the mouth and watching the chest swelling. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the method of first aid for treating victims of cardiac arrest (complete stop of heartbeat). Airway, Breathing, and Circulation skills ABC method stands for Airway , Breathing , and Circulation . [ 31 ] The same mnemonic is used by emergency health professionals . It is focused on critical life-saving intervention, and it must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries. Attention must first be brought to the airway to ensure it is clear . An obstruction (choking) is a life-threatening emergency. If an object blocks the airway, it requires anti-choking procedures . Following any evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of breathing and provide rescue breathing if safe to do so. Assessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients. Some organizations add a fourth step of \"D\" for Deadly bleeding or Defibrillation , while others consider this as part of the Circulation step simply referred as Disability. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider. Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments or examination, as required if they possess the proper training (such as measuring pupil dilation). [ 32 ] Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the \"3Bs\": Breathing , Bleeding , and Bones (or \"4Bs\": Breathing , Bleeding , Burns , and Bones ). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both artificial respiration and chest compressions to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of cervical spine injuries when ensuring an open airway. The patient must have an open airway—that is, an unobstructed passage that allows air to travel from the open mouth or uncongested nose , down through the pharynx and into the lungs. Conscious people maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to do so, as the part of the brain that manages spontaneous breathing may not be functioning. Whether conscious or not, the patient may be placed in the recovery position , laying on their side. In addition to relaxing the patient, this can have the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx . It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents. The airway can also become blocked by a foreign object. To dislodge the object and solve the choking case, the first aider may use anti-choking methods (such as 'back slaps, 'chest thrusts' or 'abdominal thrusts'). Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would reassess the patient's breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally (e.g., agonal breathing ), the first aider would initiate CPR , which attempts to restart the patient's breathing by forcing air into the lungs. They may also manually massage the heart to promote blood flow around the body. If the choking person is an infant, the first aider may use anti-choking methods for babies. During that procedure, series of five strong blows are delivered on the infant's upper back after placing the infant's face in the aider's forearm. If the infant is able to cough or cry, no breathing assistance should be given. Chest thrusts can also be applied with two fingers on the lower half of the middle of the chest. Coughing and crying indicate the airway is open and the foreign object will likely to come out from the force the coughing or crying produces. [ 33 ] A first responder should know how to use an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) in the case of a person having a sudden cardiac arrest. The survival rate of those who have a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is low. Permanent brain damage sets in after five minutes of no oxygen delivery, so rapid action on the part of the rescuer is necessary. An AED is a device that can examine a heartbeat and produce electric shocks to restart the heart. [ 34 ] A first aider should be prepared to quickly deal with less severe problems such as cuts , grazes or bone fracture . They may be able to completely resolve a situation if they have the proper training and equipment. For situations that are more severe, complex or dangerous, a first aider might need to do the best they can with the equipment they have, and wait for an ambulance to arrive at the scene. First aid kits A first aid kit consists of a strong, durable bag or transparent plastic box. They are commonly identified with a white cross on a green background. A first aid kit does not have to be bought ready-made. The advantage of ready-made first aid kits are that they have well organized compartments and familiar layouts. Contents There is no universal agreement upon the list for the contents of a first aid kit. The UK Health and Safety Executive stress that the contents of workplace first aid kits will vary according to the nature of the work activities. [ 35 ] As an example of possible contents of a kit, British Standard BS 8599 First Aid Kits for the Workplace [ 36 ] lists the following items: Information leaflet Medium sterile dressings Large sterile dressings Bandages Triangular dressings Safety pins Adhesive dressings Sterile wet wipes Microporous tape Nitrile gloves Face shield Foil blanket Burn dressings Clothing shears Conforming bandages Finger dressing Antiseptic cream Scissors Tweezers Cotton Training principles Basic principles, such as knowing the use of adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs before an actual emergency . And, in many countries, calling emergency medical services allows listening basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way. Training is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance , or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes. 1.Junior level certificate Basic Life Support 2.Senior level certificate 3.Special certificate Types of first aid which require training There are several types of first aid (and first aider) that require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken. Aquatic/Marine first aid is usually practiced by professionals such as lifeguards , professional mariners or in diver rescue , and covers the specific problems which may be faced after water-based rescue or delayed MedEvac . Battlefield first aid takes into account the specific needs of treating wounded combatants and non-combatants during armed conflict . Conflict First Aid focuses on support for stability and recovery of personal, social, group or system well-being and to address circumstantial safety needs. Hyperbaric first aid may be practiced by underwater diving professionals, who need to treat conditions such as decompression sickness . Oxygen first aid is the providing of oxygen to casualties with conditions resulting in hypoxia . It is also a standard first aid procedure for underwater diving incidents where gas bubble formation in the tissues is possible. Wilderness first aid is the provision of first aid under conditions where the arrival of emergency responders or the evacuation of an injured person may be delayed due to constraints of terrain, weather, and available persons or equipment. It may be necessary to care for an injured person for several hours or days. Mental health first aid is taught independently of physical first aid. How to support someone experiencing a mental health problem or in a crisis situation. Also how to identify the first signs of someone developing mental ill health and guide people towards appropriate help. First aid services Some people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather. They may be designated as a first aider , or use some other title. This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross society and St. John Ambulance , [ 37 ] or as paid employment with a medical contractor. People performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed. Symbols Although commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the Red Cross . According to the Geneva Conventions and other international laws, the use of this and similar symbols is reserved for official agencies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent , and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution. The internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below. Some organizations may make use of the Star of Life , although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the Maltese Cross , like the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and St John Ambulance . Other symbols may also be used.

        "content": "A medical emergency is an acute injury or illness that poses an immediate risk to a person's life or long-term health, sometimes referred to as a situation risking \"life or limb\". These emergencies may require assistance from another, qualified person, as some of these emergencies, such as cardiovascular (heart), respiratory, and gastrointestinal cannot be dealt with by the victim themselves. [ 1 ] Dependent on the severity of the emergency, and the quality of any treatment given, it may require the involvement of multiple levels of care, from first aiders through emergency medical technicians , paramedics , emergency physicians and anesthesiologists . Any response to an emergency medical situation will depend strongly on the situation, the patient involved, and availability of resources to help them. It will also vary depending on whether the emergency occurs whilst in hospital under medical care, or outside medical care (for instance, in the street or alone at home). Response Summoning emergency services For emergencies starting outside medical care, a key component of providing proper care is to summon the emergency medical services (usually an ambulance ), by calling for help using the appropriate local emergency telephone number , such as 999 , 911 , 111 , 112 or 000 . After determining that the incident is a medical emergency (as opposed to, for example, a police call), the emergency dispatchers will generally run through a questioning system such as AMPDS in order to assess the priority level of the call, along with the caller's name and location. First aid and assisting emergency services Those who are trained to perform first aid can act within the bounds of the knowledge they have, whilst awaiting the next level of definitive care. Those who are not able to perform first aid can also assist by remaining calm and staying with the injured or ill person. A common complaint of emergency service personnel is the propensity of people to crowd around the scene of a victim, as it is generally unhelpful, making the patient more stressed, and obstructing the smooth working of the emergency services. If possible, first responders should designate a specific person to ensure that the emergency services are called. Another bystander should be sent to wait for their arrival and direct them to the proper location. Additional bystanders can be helpful in ensuring that crowds are moved away from the ill or injured patient, allowing the responder adequate space to work. Legal protections for responders To prevent the delay of life-saving aid from bystanders, many states of the USA have \" Good Samaritan laws \" which protect civilian responders who choose to assist in an emergency. In many situations, the general public may delay giving care due to fear of liability should they accidentally cause harm. Good Samaritan laws often protect responders who act within the scope of their knowledge and training, as a \"reasonable person\" in the same situation would act. The concept of implied consent can protect first responders in emergency situations. A first responder may not legally touch a patient without the patient's consent. However, consent may be either expressed or implied : [ 3 ] If a patient is able to make decisions, they must give expressed, informed consent before aid is given. However, if a patient is too injured or ill to make decisions – for example, if they are unconscious, have an altered mental status , or cannot communicate - implied consent applies. Implied consent means that treatment can be given, because it is assumed that the patient would want that care. Usually, once care has begun, a first responder or first aid provider may not leave the patient or terminate care until a responder of equal or higher training (such as an emergency medical technician ) assumes care. This can constitute abandonment of the patient and may subject the responder to legal liability. Care must be continued until the patient is transferred to a higher level of care; the situation becomes too unsafe to continue; or the responder is physically unable to continue due to exhaustion or hazards. Unless the situation is particularly hazardous and is likely to further endanger the patient, evacuating an injured victim requires special skills, and should be left to the professionals of the emergency medical and fire service. The chain of survival During a medical emergency in which a patient is no longer breathing and does not have a pulse , survival is predicated on adherence to the chain of survival , which has four components: Early access to emergency care Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Early defibrillation Early advanced life support (ALS) Clinical response Within hospital settings, an adequate staff is generally present to deal with the average emergency situation. Emergency medicine physicians and anaesthesiologists have training to deal with most medical emergencies, and maintain CPR and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certifications. In disasters or complex emergencies, most hospitals have protocols to summon on-site and off-site staff rapidly. Both emergency department and inpatient medical emergencies follow the basic protocol of Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Irrespective of the nature of the emergency, adequate blood pressure and oxygenation are required before the cause of the emergency can be eliminated. Possible exceptions include the clamping of arteries in severe hemorrhage . [ citation needed ] Non-trauma emergencies While the golden hour is a trauma treatment concept, two emergency medical conditions have well-documented time-critical treatment considerations: stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack). In the case of stroke, there is a window of three hours within which the benefit of thrombolytic drugs outweighs the risk of major bleeding. In the case of a heart attack, rapid stabilization of fatal arrhythmias can prevent sudden cardiac arrest. In addition, there is a direct relationship between time-to-treatment and the success of reperfusion (restoration of blood flow to the heart), including a time-dependent reduction in the mortality and morbidity .

        "content": "Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of traditional first aid to cover mental health conditions. Mental health first aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person experiencing or developing a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorders , or experiencing a mental health crisis situation such as suicidal ideation or panic attack . Mental health first aid training Mental health first aid training teaches members of the public how to help a person who is experiencing varying degrees of worsening mental health issues. [ 1 ] Like traditional first aid training, mental health first aid training does not teach people to treat or diagnose mental health or substance use conditions. [ 2 ] Instead, the training teaches people how to offer initial support until appropriate professional help is received or until the crisis resolves. [ 2 ] History The first mental health first aid training program was developed in Australia in 2001 by a research team led by Betty Kitchener and Anthony Jorm . [ 3 ] The program was created to teach members of the general public how to provide initial support to people experiencing mental health problems, as well as to connect them with appropriate professional help and community resources. [ 4 ] They tested the idea that giving first aid for mental health could lessen the effects of mental health problems, speed up recovery, and make suicide less likely by educating students on common mental health crises [ 1 ] including feelings of suicide, deliberate self-harm, panic attacks, or symptoms of psychosis, and how to deal with these situations. [ 1 ] [ 5 ] The idea was to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and make it more likely that people with mental health problems would seek help, which would reduce the risk of the person coming to harm. [ 1 ] Mental health first aid training programs are provided by different organizations around the world, many of them non-profit. They have been implemented in countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and a number of other European, Asian, and African countries. [ 6 ] Public reception General media articles and videos indicate that mental health first aid training has political and celebrity proponents, such as former US president Barack Obama , [ 7 ] former US first lady Michelle Obama , [ 8 ] and singer/actress Lady Gaga . [ 9 ] A few bills of law have been proposed by politicians in countries such as Australia [ 10 ] and the United Kingdom [ 11 ] to make mental health first aid training compulsory in schools and other organizations. Although considered good practice in several countries, mental health first aid training is not legally imposed for organizations anywhere in the world. Curriculum The curriculum for mental health first aid training typically includes the following topics: Symptoms associated with common mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders, as well as a general overview of mental health and mental illnesses. [ 5 ] [ 2 ] Common warning signs of mental illnesses, such as mood, behavior, and cognitive changes. [ 5 ] Information about local counseling and psychiatric services, and how to help others gain access to them. [ 5 ] Using the knowledge from those topics, participants are trained on a step-by-step action plan for providing mental health first aid, including how to: [ 12 ] Evaluate the risk of suicide or harm Approach safely and appropriately Listen non-judgmentally Provide reassurance Encourage appropriate professional assistance Promote self-help Additional support strategies Depending on the program, there may be additional modules that target specific populations, such as children and adolescents, the elderly, or veterans. [ 13 ] or conditions such as substance use disorder and its related issues and challenges. [ 13 ] All of these topics are covered in order to develop participants' mental health literacy which consists of the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to recognize and respond appropriately to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. [ 13 ] Research on mental health first aid training A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been carried out to review data concerning the effectiveness of mental health first aid training on participants' knowledge of mental health conditions and subsequent helping behaviors. [ 2 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2014 concluded that mental health first aid training increases participants' knowledge of mental health, reduces their negative views, and increases their supportive behaviors toward people with mental health issues. [ 14 ] A meta-analysis conducted in 2018 concluded that mental health first aid training enhances participants' knowledge, awareness, and beliefs about successful treatments for mental diseases. [ 15 ] At follow-up, there were slight improvements in the amount of assistance provided to a person with a mental health problem, but the nature of the change in the offered behaviors was unclear. [ 15 ] A systematic review conducted in 2020 showed that mental health first aid training had conflicting effects on how trainees applied the skills they learned, but no influence on how beneficial their actions were for the mental health of the recipients. [ 16 ] A systematic review conducted in 2020 focused on youth and adolescent mental health first aid training and found significant improvements in the understanding, recognition, stigmatizing perceptions, helping motivations, and helping behavior of youth and adolescent participants. [ 17 ] The most frequently stated improvement was in knowledge and confidence, while the least frequently reported improvement was in helping behavior. [ 17 ] As of 2024, the mental health first aid programme has been exported to over 25 countries and trained up over 6 million people worldwide, with over 1 million trained within Australia [ 18 ] [ 19 ] See also Emotional First Aid First responder , a specialist who is among the first to arrive and provide assistance at the scene of an emergency Mental disorder Mental health triage – A brief overview of the Australian concept for dealing with psychiatric emergencies, similar to regular triage Mobile Crisis , first responder service providing mental health evaluations, de-escalation, and referral to other services Police crisis intervention team , American movement of partnerships between law enforcement and mental health services Psychological first aid Public health , organized efforts to prevent disease, prolong life and promote health in a population Warning signs of suicide References and notes ^ a b c d Kitchener BA, Jorm AF (October 2002). \"Mental health first aid training for the public: evaluation of effects on knowledge, attitudes and helping behavior\" .

It was developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) and National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (NC-PTSD), a section of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs , in 2006. It has been endorsed and used by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), the American Psychological Association (APA) and many others. It was developed in a two-day intensive collaboration, involving more than 25 disaster mental health researchers, an online survey of the first cohort that used PFA and repeated reviews of the draft. [ 1 ] Definition According to the NCTSN and NC-PTSD, psychological first aid is an evidence-informed modular approach for assisting people in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism to reduce initial distress and to foster short and long-term adaptive functioning. It was used by non-mental health experts, such as responders and volunteers. Other characteristics include non-intrusive pragmatic care and assessing needs. PFA does not necessarily involve discussion of the traumatic event and avoids any activity associated with \"debriefing\" as that technique has been associated with increased rates of PTSD. [ 2 ] Components Protecting from further harm Opportunity to talk without pressure Active listening Compassion Addressing and acknowledging concerns Discussing coping strategies Social support Offer to return to talk Referral Steps Contact and engagement Safety and comfort Stabilization Information gathering Practical assistance Connection with social supports Coping information Linkage with services History Before PFA, there was a procedure known as debriefing . Debriefing was a necessary step in a commercially available training intended to reduce PTSD called \"Critical Incident Stress Management\" (CISM) . It was intended to reduce the incidence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a major disaster. PTSD is now widely known to be debilitating; sufferers experience avoidance, flashbacks, hyper-vigilance, and numbness. Debriefing procedures were made a requirement after a disaster, with a desire to prevent people from developing PTSD. The idea behind it was to promote emotional processing by encouraging recollection of the event. Debriefing has origins with the military, where sessions were intended to boost morale and reduce distress after a mission, however the US Department of Defense discontinued the practice in 2002 due to evidence indicating that the practice increased PTSD rates. [ 3 ] Debriefing was done in a single session with seven stages: introduction, facts, thoughts and impressions, emotional reactions, normalization, planning for future, and disengagement. [ 2 ] Debriefing was found to be at best, ineffective, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and at worst, harmful [ 8 ] with some studies finding that PTSD rates actually increased as a result of debriefing. [ 2 ] There are several theories as to why debriefing increased incidence of PTSD. First, those who were likely to develop PTSD were not helped by a single session. Second, being re-exposed too soon to the trauma could lead to retraumatization. Exposure therapy in cognitive behavioral therapy allows the person to adjust to the stimuli before slowly increasing severity. Debriefing did not allow for this. Also, normal distress was seen to be pathological after a debriefing and those who had been through a trauma thought they had a mental disorder because they were upset. Debriefing assumes that everyone reacts the same way to a trauma, and anyone who deviates from that path, is pathological. But there are many ways to cope with a trauma, especially so soon after it happens. [ 9 ] [ 2 ] Effectiveness PFA seems to address many of the issues in debriefing. It is not compulsory and can be done in multiple sessions and links those who need more help to services. It deals with practical issues which are often more pressing and create stress. It also improves self-efficacy by letting people cope their own way. PFA has attempted to be culturally sensitive , but whether it is or not has not been shown. However, a drawback is the lack of empirical evidence . [ 10 ] While it is based on research, it is not proven by research. [ 11 ] A 2024 integrative review concluded that the substantial variation in PFA protocols limits the ability to reach scientific conclusions. [ 12 ] Like the debriefing method, PFA has become widely popular without testing, however debriefing is linked to harmful outcomes whereas PFA specifically avoids debriefing.

        "content": "Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) [ b ] is a mental disorder that develops from experiencing a traumatic event, such as sexual assault , domestic violence , child abuse , warfare and its associated traumas, natural disaster, bereavement, traffic collision , or other threats on a person's life or well-being. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma -related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in the way a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 9 ] These symptoms last for more than a month after the event and can include triggers such as misophonia . [ 1 ] Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play . [ 10 ] [ 1 ] Most people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD. [ 2 ] People who experience interpersonal violence such as rape, other sexual assaults, being kidnapped, stalking, physical abuse by an intimate partner, and childhood abuse are more likely to develop PTSD than those who experience non- assault based trauma, such as accidents and natural disasters . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Prevention may be possible when counselling is targeted at those with early symptoms, but is not effective when provided to all trauma-exposed individuals regardless of whether symptoms are present. [ 2 ] The main treatments for people with PTSD are counselling (psychotherapy) and medication. [ 4 ] [ 14 ] Most combination therapy (psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy) does not seem to be more effective than psychotherapy alone, [ 2 ] [ 15 ] except for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . [ 16 ] Benefits from medication are less than those seen with counselling. [ 2 ] Antidepressants of the SSRI or SNRI type are the first-line medications used for PTSD and are moderately beneficial for about half of people. [ 5 ] Medications, other than some SSRIs or SNRIs, do not have enough evidence to support their use and, in the case of benzodiazepines , may worsen outcomes. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] In the United States, about 3.5% of adults have PTSD in a given year, and 9% of people develop it at some point in their lives. [ 1 ] In much of the rest of the world, rates during a given year are between 0.5% and 1%. [ 1 ] Higher rates may occur in regions of armed conflict . [ 2 ] It is more common in women than men. [ 19 ] Symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders have been documented since at least the time of the ancient Greeks . [ 20 ] A few instances of evidence of post-traumatic illness have been argued to exist from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as the diary of Samuel Pepys , who described intrusive and distressing symptoms following the 1666 Fire of London . [ 21 ] During the world wars , the condition was known under various terms, including \" shell shock \", \"war nerves\", neurasthenia and ' combat neurosis '. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The term \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" came into use in the 1970s, in large part due to the diagnoses of U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War . [ 24 ] It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). [ 25 ] Signs and symptoms Symptoms of PTSD generally begin within the first three months after the inciting traumatic event, but may not begin until years later. [ 26 ] [ 4 ] In the typical case, the individual with PTSD persistently avoids either trauma-related thoughts and emotions or discussion of the traumatic event and may even have amnesia of the event ( dissociative amnesia ). [ 1 ] However, the event is commonly relived by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, dissociative episodes of reliving the trauma (\" flashbacks \"), and nightmares (50 to 70%). [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] While it is common to have symptoms after any traumatic event, these must persist to a sufficient degree (i.e., causing dysfunction in life or clinical levels of distress) for longer than one month after the trauma to be classified as PTSD (clinically significant dysfunction or distress for less than one month after the trauma may be acute stress disorder ). [ 1 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Some following a traumatic event experience post-traumatic growth . [ 33 ] Trauma victims social interactions, with significant others, have been shown to influence PTSD symptoms. Countersupportive interactions include criticism, making the victim feel guilty, or telling them they are crazy. [ 34 ] Associated medical conditions Trauma survivors often develop depression, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders in addition to PTSD. [ 35 ] More than 50% of those with PTSD have co-morbid anxiety , mood , or substance use disorders . [ 36 ] Substance use disorder , such as alcohol use disorder , commonly co-occur with PTSD. [ 37 ] Recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder or other anxiety disorders may be hindered, or the condition worsened, when substance use disorders are comorbid with PTSD. Resolving these problems can bring about improvement in an individual's mental health status and anxiety levels. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] PTSD has a strong association with tinnitus , [ 40 ] and speculation exists that PTSD may cause some tinnitus seen in association with the condition. [ 41 ] PTSD is also associated with several physical health comorbidities that involve inflammatory processes and immune system dysregulation. [ 42 ] In children and adolescents, there is a strong association between emotional regulation difficulties (e.g., mood swings, anger outbursts, temper tantrums ) and post-traumatic stress symptoms, independent of age, gender, or type of trauma. [ 43 ] Moral injury , the feeling of moral distress, such as shame or guilt following a moral transgression, is associated with PTSD but is distinguished from it. Moral injury is associated with shame and guilt, while PTSD is associated with anxiety and fear. [ 44 ] : 2,8,11 Risk factors Persons considered at risk for developing PTSD include combat military personnel, survivors of natural disasters, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of violent crime. Persons employed in occupations that expose them to violence (such as soldiers) or disasters (such as emergency service workers) are also at risk. [ 46 ] Other occupations at an increased risk include police officers, firefighters, [ 47 ] first responders, ambulance personnel, health care professionals, train drivers, divers, journalists, and sailors, as well as people who work at banks, post offices, or in stores. [ 48 ] The intensity of the traumatic event is also associated with a subsequent risk of developing PTSD, with experiences related to witnessed death, or witnessed or experienced torture, injury, bodily disfigurement, traumatic brain injury being highly associated with the development of PTSD. Similarly, experiences that are unexpected or in which the victim cannot escape are also associated with a high risk of developing PTSD. [ 36 ] Trauma PTSD has been associated with a wide range of traumatic events. The risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event varies by trauma type [ 49 ] [ 50 ] and is the highest following exposure to sexual violence (11.4%), particularly rape (19.0%). [ 51 ] Men are more likely to experience a traumatic event (of any type), but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault . [ 52 ] Motor vehicle collision survivors, both children and adults, are at an increased risk of PTSD. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Globally, about 2.6% of adults are diagnosed with PTSD following a non-life-threatening traffic accident, and a similar proportion of children develop PTSD. [ 51 ] Risk of PTSD almost doubles to 4.6% for life-threatening auto accidents. [ 51 ] Females were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD following a road traffic accident , whether the accident occurred during childhood or adulthood. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Post-traumatic stress reactions have been studied in children and adolescents. [ 55 ] The rate of PTSD might be lower in children than adults, but in the absence of therapy, symptoms may continue for decades. [ 56 ] One estimate suggests that the proportion of children and adolescents having PTSD in a non-wartorn population in a developed country may be 1% compared to 1.5% to 3% of adults. [ 56 ] On average, 16% of children exposed to a traumatic event develop PTSD, with the incidence varying according to the type of exposure and gender. [ 57 ] Similar to the adult population, risk factors for PTSD in children include: female gender , exposure to disasters, maladaptive coping behaviors , [ 58 ] or lacking proper social support systems. [ 59 ] Predictor models have consistently found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, neurobiological differences, and familial stressors are associated with risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] It has been difficult to find consistently predictive aspects of the events that predict, but peritraumatic dissociation has been a fairly consistent predictive indicator of the development of PTSD. [ 63 ] Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact. It has been speculated that interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal ones, [ 64 ] but this is controversial. [ 65 ] The risk of developing PTSD is increased in individuals who are exposed to physical abuse , physical assault , or kidnapping . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Women who experience physical violence are more likely to develop PTSD than men. [ 66 ] An individual that has been exposed to domestic violence is predisposed to the development of PTSD. There is a strong association between the development of PTSD in mothers who experienced domestic violence during the perinatal period of their pregnancy. [ 68 ] Those who have experienced sexual assault or rape may develop symptoms of PTSD. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] The likelihood of sustained symptoms of PTSD is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew. The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor. [ 71 ] Military service in combat is a risk factor for developing PTSD. [ 36 ] Around 22% of people exposed to combat develop PTSD; in about 25% of military personnel who develop PTSD, its appearance is delayed. [ 36 ] Refugees are also at an increased risk for PTSD due to their exposure to war, hardships, and traumatic events. The rates for PTSD within refugee populations range from 4% to 86%. [ 72 ] While the stresses of war affect everyone involved, displaced persons are more so than others. [ 73 ] Challenges related to the overall psychosocial well-being of refugees are complex and individually nuanced. Refugees have reduced levels of well-being and a high rate of mental distress due to past and ongoing trauma. Groups that are particularly affected and whose needs often remain unmet are women, older people, and unaccompanied minors. [ 74 ] Post-traumatic stress and depression in refugee populations also tend to affect their educational success. [ 74 ] Sudden, unexpected death of a loved one is the most common traumatic event type reported in cross-national studies. [ 51 ] [ 75 ] However, the majority of people who experience this type of event will not develop PTSD. An analysis from the WHO World Mental Health Surveys found a 5.2% risk of developing PTSD after learning of the unexpected death of a loved one. [ 75 ] Because of the high prevalence of this type of traumatic event, the unexpected death of a loved one accounts for approximately 20% of PTSD cases worldwide. [ 51 ] Medical conditions associated with an increased risk of PTSD include cancer, [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] heart attack, [ 79 ] and stroke. [ 80 ] 22% of cancer survivors present with lifelong PTSD like symptoms. [ 81 ] Intensive-care unit (ICU) hospitalization is also a risk factor for PTSD. [ 82 ] Some women experience PTSD from their experiences related to breast cancer and mastectomy . [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 76 ] Loved ones of those who experience life-threatening illnesses are also at risk for developing PTSD, such as parents of a child with chronic illnesses. [ 85 ] Research exists that demonstrates that survivors of psychotic episodes , which exist in diseases such as schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar I disorder , and others, are at greater risk of developing PTSD. This is often due to the experiences one may have during and after psychosis. Such traumatic experiences include, but are not limited to, experiences in psychiatric hospitals , police interactions, social stigma, and embarrassment due to psychotic behavior, suicidal behavior and attempts, distressing delusions and hallucinations, and the fear of losing control or actual loss of control. The incidence of PTSD in survivors of psychosis may be as low as 11% and as high at 67%. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Prevalence estimates of cancer‐related PTSD range between 7% and 14%, [ 89 ] with an additional 10% to 20% of patients experiencing subsyndromal post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Both PTSD and PTSS have been associated with increased distress and impaired quality of life, [ 92 ] and have been reported in newly diagnosed patients as well as in long‐term survivors. [ 93 ] The PTSD Field Trials for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), revealed that 22% of cancer survivors present with lifetime cancer-related PTSD (CR-PTSD), endorsing cancer diagnosis and treatment as a traumatic stressor. [ 94 ] Therefore, as the number of people diagnosed with cancer increases and cancer survivorship improves, cancer-related PTSD becomes a more prominent issue, so providing for cancer patients' physical and psychological needs becomes increasingly important. [ 95 ] Women who experience miscarriage are at risk of PTSD. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Those who experience subsequent miscarriages have an increased risk of PTSD compared to those experiencing only one. [ 96 ] PTSD can also occur after childbirth and the risk increases if a woman has experienced trauma before the pregnancy. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (that is, excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8 and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum, [ 101 ] with rates dropping to 1.5% at six months postpartum. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Symptoms of PTSD are common following childbirth, with prevalence of 24–30.1% [ 101 ] at six weeks, dropping to 13.6% at six months. [ 103 ] Emergency childbirth is also associated with PTSD. [ 104 ] People who experience natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and fires can develop post-traumatic stress disorder. [ 105 ] A literature review of studies examining PTSD following disasters between 1980 and 2007 found that the prevalence of PTSD after natural disasters was lower than the prevalence of the condition after man-made disasters. This review found prevalence rates between 3.7% to 60%. Research has shown that PTSD impacts approximately one in four earthquake survivors (23.66 %). [ 106 ] Determinants of the risk of PTSD developing after disaster include the extent of physical injury, risk of life, and number of fatalities. [ 107 ] Geographical proximity to the epicenter of a natural disaster has been shown to contribute to people developing PTSD. [ 108 ] Natural disasters can displace families and challenge people’s sense of control and security. [ 109 ] Mental health recovery of individuals, communities and countries after emergencies, including natural disasters, is important for social and economic reasons. Mental health emergency preparedness and response need to be effective after natural disasters. [ 110 ] Genetics There is evidence that susceptibility to PTSD is hereditary . Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused by genetics alone. [ 63 ] For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin's having PTSD compared to dizygotic twins (non-identical twins). [ 111 ] Women with a smaller hippocampus might be more likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic event based on preliminary findings. [ 112 ] Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized anxiety disorders, and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and drug dependence share greater than 40% genetic similarities. [ 63 ] Neuroscientist Dr. Rachel Yehuda researched how psychological trauma can travel across generations, specifically focusing on trans-generational trauma with Holocaust survivors and their offspring. The researchers in her study focused on a stress gene called FKBP5 that is linked to PTSD. The results of this study underscore the genetic components of PTSD as they showed an effect on methylation of the FKBP5 gene both in the parents who experienced trauma in concentration camps, as well as their offspring. [ 113 ] Evolutionary Evolutionary Psychiatry and Evolutionary Psychology perspectives interpret PTSD symptoms as extreme or dysregulated forms of defensive responses that were advantageous in ancestral contexts. [ 114 ] Hypervigilance, intrusive memories, and exaggerated startle responses may reflect overactivation of mechanisms designed to promote survival after trauma. [ 115 ] While these accounts can help contextualize symptom clusters, reviews emphasize that they remain theoretical and require integration with neurobiological and psychosocial research. Pathophysiology Neuroendocrinology PTSD symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an overreactive adrenaline response, which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain. These patterns can persist long after the event that triggered the fear, making an individual hyper-responsive to future fearful situations. [ 30 ] [ 116 ] During traumatic experiences, the high levels of stress hormones secreted suppress hypothalamic activity that may be a major factor toward the development of PTSD. [ 117 ] PTSD causes biochemical changes in the brain and body that differ from other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression . Individuals diagnosed with PTSD respond more strongly to a dexamethasone suppression test than individuals diagnosed with clinical depression . [ 118 ] [ 119 ] Most people with PTSD show a low secretion of cortisol and high secretion of catecholamines in urine , [ 120 ] with a norepinephrine /cortisol ratio consequently higher than comparable non-diagnosed individuals. [ 121 ] This is in contrast to the normative fight-or-flight response , in which both catecholamine and cortisol levels are elevated after exposure to a stressor. [ 122 ] Brain catecholamine levels are high, [ 123 ] and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations are high. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Together, these findings suggest abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis . The maintenance of fear has been shown to include the HPA axis, the locus coeruleus - noradrenergic systems, and the connections between the limbic system and frontal cortex . The HPA axis that coordinates the hormonal response to stress, [ 126 ] which activates the LC-noradrenergic system, is implicated in the over-consolidation of memories that occurs in the aftermath of trauma. [ 127 ] This over-consolidation increases the likelihood of one's developing PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for threat detection and the conditioned and unconditioned fear responses that are carried out as a response to a threat. [ 63 ] The HPA axis is responsible for coordinating the hormonal response to stress. [ 63 ] Given the strong cortisol suppression to dexamethasone in PTSD, HPA axis abnormalities are likely predicated on strong negative feedback inhibition of cortisol, itself due to an increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors . [ 128 ] PTSD has been hypothesized to be a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and hyperresponsive HPA axis. [ 129 ] Low cortisol levels may predispose individuals to PTSD: Following war trauma, Swedish soldiers serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina with low pre-service salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with PTSD symptoms, following war trauma, than soldiers with normal pre-service levels. [ 130 ] Because cortisol is normally important in restoring homeostasis after the stress response, it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is, longer and more distressing—response, setting the stage for PTSD. It is thought that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system mediates the over-consolidation of fear memory. High levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity, and because people with PTSD tend to have reduced levels of cortisol, it has been proposed that individuals with PTSD cannot regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress. [ 117 ] Intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses are thought to be a result of the response to associated triggers. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been reported to reduce the release of norepinephrine and has been demonstrated to have anxiolytic properties in animal models. Studies have shown that people with PTSD demonstrate reduced levels of NPY, possibly indicating their increased anxiety levels. [ 63 ] Other studies indicate that people with PTSD have chronically low levels of serotonin , which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity. [ 131 ] Serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid production. Dopamine levels in a person with PTSD can contribute to symptoms: low levels can contribute to anhedonia , apathy , impaired attention , and motor deficits; high levels can contribute to psychosis , agitation , and restlessness. [ 131 ] Studies have also described elevated concentrations of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine in PTSD. [ 132 ] This kind of type 2 allostatic adaptation may contribute to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and other stress mediators. Hyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can also be caused by continued exposure to high stress. Overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with PTSD. A decrease in other norepinephrine functions (awareness of the current environment) prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing the experience, and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environment. [ 131 ] There is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of PTSD. A 2012 review showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and PTSD. The majority of reports indicate people with PTSD have elevated levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone , lower basal cortisol levels, and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the HPA axis by dexamethasone . [ 63 ] [ 133 ] Neuroimmunology Studies on the peripheral immune have found dysfunction with elevated cytokine levels and a higher risk of immune-related chronic diseases among individuals with PTSD. [ 134 ] Neuroimmune dysfunction has also been found in PTSD, raising the possibility of a suppressed central immune response due to reduced activity of microglia in the brain in response to immune challenges. Individuals with PTSD, compared to controls, have a lower increase in a marker of microglial activation ( 18-kDa translocator protein ) following lipopolysaccharide administration. [ 135 ] This neuroimmune suppression is also associated with greater severity of anhedonic symptoms. Researchers suggest that treatments aimed at restoring neuroimmune function could be beneficial for alleviating PTSD symptoms. [ 135 ] Neuroanatomy A meta-analysis of structural MRI studies found an association with reduced total brain volume, intracranial volume, and volumes of the hippocampus , insula cortex , and anterior cingulate . [ 137 ] Much of this research stems from PTSD in those exposed to the Vietnam War. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] People with PTSD have decreased brain activity in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , areas linked to the experience and regulation of emotion. [ 140 ] The amygdala is strongly involved in forming emotional memories, especially fear-related memories. During high stress, the hippocampus , which is associated with placing memories in the correct context of space and time and memory recall, is suppressed. According to one theory, this suppression may be the cause of the flashbacks that can affect people with PTSD. When someone with PTSD undergoes stimuli similar to the traumatic event, the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the person's memory. [ 63 ] [ 141 ] The amygdalocentric model of PTSD proposes that the amygdala is very much aroused and insufficiently controlled by the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, in particular during extinction . [ 142 ] This is consistent with an interpretation of PTSD as a syndrome of deficient extinction ability. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The basolateral nucleus (BLA) of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli, which results in the fear conditioning present in PTSD. The BLA activates the central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala, which elaborates the fear response (including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response). Descending inhibitory inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulate the transmission from the BLA to the CeA, which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses. [ 63 ] While as a whole, amygdala hyperactivity is reported by meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging in PTSD, there is a large degree of heterogeneity, more so than in social anxiety disorder or phobic disorder. Comparing dorsal (roughly the CeA) and ventral (roughly the BLA) clusters, hyperactivity is more robust in the ventral cluster, while hypoactivity is evident in the dorsal cluster. The distinction may explain the blunted emotions in PTSD (via desensitization in the CeA) as well as the fear-related component. [ 144 ] In a 2007 study, Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans who did not have such symptoms. [ 145 ] This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). [ 146 ] Evidence suggests that endogenous cannabinoid levels are reduced in PTSD, particularly anandamide , and that cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are increased to compensate. [ 147 ] There appears to be a link between increased CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala and abnormal threat processing and hyperarousal, but not dysphoria, in trauma survivors. A 2020 study found no evidence for conclusions from prior research that suggested low IQ is a risk factor for developing PTSD. [ 148 ] Diagnosis NICE recommends clinicians familiarise themselves with the range of symptoms associated with functional impairment and events that are known to contribute to the development of PTSD. It is advised to ask specific questions when assessing and to consider the frequency of traumatic events experienced. Assessment should be comprehensive, including an assessment of physical, psychological, and social needs and a risk assessment. [ 149 ] PTSD can be difficult to diagnose because of: the subjective nature of most of the diagnostic criteria (although this is true for many mental disorders); the potential for over-reporting , e.g., while seeking disability benefits, or when PTSD could be a mitigating factor at criminal sentencing [ 150 ] the potential for under-reporting, e.g., stigma, pride, fear that a PTSD diagnosis might preclude certain employment opportunities; symptom overlap with other mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; [ 151 ] association with other mental disorders such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; substance use disorders, which often produce some of the same signs and symptoms as PTSD; and substance use disorders can increase vulnerability to PTSD or exacerbate PTSD symptoms or both; and PTSD increases the risk of developing substance use disorders. [ 152 ] the differential expression of symptoms culturally (specifically with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms) [ 153 ] Screening There are a number of PTSD screening instruments for adults, such as the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [ 154 ] [ 155 ] and the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5). [ 156 ] The 17 item PTSD checklist is also capable of monitoring the severity of symptoms and the response to treatment. [ 36 ] There are also several screening and assessment instruments for use with children and adolescents. These include the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire, [ 159 ] [ 160 ] and UCLA Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for DSM-IV . [ 161 ] [ 162 ] In addition, there are also screening and assessment instruments for caregivers of very young children (six years of age and younger). These include the Young Child PTSD Screen, [ 163 ] the Young Child PTSD Checklist, [ 163 ] and the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment. [ 164 ] Assessment Evidence-based assessment principles, including a multimethod assessment approach, form the foundation of PTSD assessment. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] : 25 Those who conduct assessments for PTSD may use various clinician-administered interviews and instruments to provide an official PTSD diagnosis. [ 168 ] Some commonly used, reliable, and valid assessment instruments for PTSD diagnosis, in accordance with the DSM-5, include the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5), PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSS-I-5), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 – PTSD Module (SCID-5 PTSD Module). [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] In the DSM and ICD PTSD was classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-IV, but has since been reclassified as a \"trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" in the DSM-5 . [ 1 ] The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD include four symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision ( ICD-10 ) classifies PTSD (code F43.1 ) under \"Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders\". [ 173 ] The ICD-10 criteria for PTSD include re-experiencing, avoidance, and either increased reactivity or inability to recall certain details related to the event. [ 173 ] The ICD-11 diagnostic description for PTSD (code 6B40 ) contains three components or symptom groups (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, and (3) heightened sense of threat. [ 174 ] [ 175 ] ICD-11 no longer includes verbal thoughts about the traumatic event as a symptom. [ 175 ] There is a predicted lower rate of diagnosed PTSD using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10 or DSM-5. [ 175 ] ICD-11 also proposes identifying a distinct subgroup with Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD; code 6B41 ), who have more often experienced several or sustained traumas and have greater functional impairment than those with PTSD. [ 175 ] Differential diagnosis A diagnosis of PTSD requires that the person has been exposed to an extreme stressor. Any stressor can result in a diagnosis of adjustment disorder , and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for PTSD. The symptom pattern for acute stress disorder must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma. If it lasts longer, and the symptom pattern fits the characteristics of PTSD, the diagnosis may be changed. [ 28 ] Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) may be diagnosed for intrusive thoughts that are recurring but not related to a specific traumatic event. [ 28 ] In extreme cases of prolonged, repeated traumatization where there is no viable chance of escape, survivors may develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder . [ 176 ] This occurs as a result of layers of trauma rather than a single traumatic event, and includes additional symptomatology, such as the loss of a coherent sense of self. [ 177 ] Prevention Modest benefits have been seen from early access to cognitive behavioral therapy . Critical incident stress management has been suggested as a means of preventing PTSD, but subsequent studies suggest it may produce negative outcomes. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] A 2019 Cochrane review did not find evidence to support the use of intervention and that \"multiple session interventions may result in worse outcomes than no intervention, for some individuals.\" [ 180 ] The World Health Organization recommends against the use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants for acute stress (symptoms lasting less than one month). [ 181 ] Some evidence supports the use of hydrocortisone for prevention in adults, although there is limited or no evidence supporting propranolol , escitalopram , temazepam , or gabapentin . [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Psychological debriefing Trauma-exposed individuals often receive treatment called psychological debriefing in an effort to prevent PTSD, which consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event. [ 184 ] However, several meta-analyses found that psychological debriefing is unhelpful, is potentially harmful and does not reduce the future risk of developing PTSD. [ 36 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ] This is true for both single-session debriefing and multiple session interventions. [ 180 ] As of 2017 the American Psychological Association assessed psychological debriefing as No Research Support/Treatment is Potentially Harmful . [ 187 ] Early intervention Trauma-focused intervention delivered within days or weeks of the potentially traumatic event has been found to decrease PTSD symptoms. [ 188 ] Similar to psychological debriefing, the goal of early intervention is to lessen the intensity and frequency of stress symptoms, to prevent new-onset or relapsed mental disorders and further distress later in the healing process. [ 189 ] Risk-targeted interventions Risk-targeted interventions are those that attempt to mitigate specific formative information or events. It can target modeling normal behaviors, instruction on a task, or giving information on the event. [ 190 ] [ 191 ] Management Combination therapy Most combination therapy (psychological and pharmacotherapy) does not seem to be more effective than psychological therapy alone, [ 2 ] [ 15 ] except for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy , a 2021 systematic review of studies found. [ 16 ] Counselling The approaches with the strongest evidence include behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies such as prolonged exposure therapy , [ 192 ] cognitive processing therapy (CBT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] [ 196 ] There is some evidence for brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP), narrative exposure therapy (NET), and written exposure therapy. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] A 2019 Cochrane review evaluated couples and family therapies compared to no care and individual and group therapies for the treatment of PTSD . [ 199 ] There were too few studies on couples therapies to determine if substantive benefits were derived, but preliminary RCTs suggested that couples therapies may be beneficial for reducing PTSD symptoms. [ 199 ] A meta-analytic comparison of EMDR and CBT found both protocols indistinguishable in terms of effectiveness in treating PTSD; however, \"the contribution of the eye movement component in EMDR to treatment outcome\" is unclear. [ 200 ] A meta-analysis in children and adolescents also found that EMDR was as efficacious as CBT. [ 201 ] Children with PTSD are far more likely to pursue treatment at school (because of its proximity and ease) than at a free clinic. [ 202 ] CBT seeks to change the way a person feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior, or both, responsible for negative emotions. Results from a 2018 systematic review found high strength of evidence that supports CBT-exposure therapy efficacious for a reduction in PTSD and depression symptoms, as well as the loss of PTSD diagnosis. [ 9 ] CBT has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD and is currently considered the standard of care for PTSD by the United States Department of Defense . [ 203 ] [ 204 ] In CBT, individuals learn to identify thoughts that make them feel afraid or upset and replace them with less distressing thoughts. The goal is to understand how certain thoughts about events cause PTSD-related stress. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] A study assessing an online version of CBT for people with mild-to-moderate PTSD found that the online approach was as effective as, and cheaper than, the same therapy given face-to-face. [ 207 ] [ 208 ] A 2021 Cochrane review assessed the provision of CBT in an Internet-based format found similar beneficial effects for Internet-based therapy as in face-to-face. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of trials reviewed. [ 209 ] Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy [ 210 ] that involves assisting trauma survivors to re-experience distressing trauma-related memories and reminders to facilitate habituation and successful emotional processing of the trauma memory. Most exposure therapy programs include both imaginal confrontation with the traumatic memories and real-life exposure to trauma reminders; this type of CBT has shown benefit in the treatment of PTSD . [ 211 ] [ 36 ] Some organizations [ which? ] have endorsed the need for exposure. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been actively training mental health treatment staff in prolonged exposure therapy [ 214 ] and cognitive processing therapy [ 215 ] in an effort to better treat U.S. veterans with PTSD. Recent research on contextually based third-generation behavior therapies suggests that they may produce results comparable to some of the better validated therapies. [ 216 ] Many of these therapy methods have a significant element of exposure [ 217 ] and have demonstrated success in treating the primary problems of PTSD and co-occurring depressive symptoms. [ 218 ] Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed and studied by Francine Shapiro . [ 219 ] She had noticed that, when she was thinking about disturbing memories herself, her eyes were moving rapidly. When she brought her eye movements under control while thinking, the thoughts were less distressing. [ 219 ] In 2002, Shapiro and Maxfield published a theory of why this might work, called adaptive information processing. [ 220 ] This theory proposes that eye movement can be used to facilitate emotional processing of memories, changing the person's memory to attend to more adaptive information. [ 221 ] The therapist initiates voluntary rapid eye movements while the person focuses on memories, feelings or thoughts about a particular trauma. [ 56 ] [ 222 ] The therapist uses hand movements to get the person to move their eyes backward and forward, but hand-tapping or tones can also be used. [ 56 ] EMDR closely resembles cognitive behavior therapy as it combines exposure (re-visiting the traumatic event), working on cognitive processes and relaxation/self-monitoring. [ 56 ] However, exposure by way of being asked to think about the experience rather than talk about it has been highlighted as one of the more important distinguishing elements of EMDR. [ 223 ] Several scientific studies have evaluated the efficacy of EMDR in adults [ 224 ] as well as children and adolescents. [ 222 ] There is moderate strength of evidence to support the efficacy of EMDR \"for reduction in PTSD symptoms, loss of diagnosis, and reduction in depressive symptoms\" according to a 2018 systematic review update. [ 9 ] In children and adolescents, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as CBT, and superior to waitlist or placebo. [ 201 ] There was some evidence that EMDR might prevent depression. [ 224 ] Adverse effects were largely unstudied. [ 224 ] The benefits were greater for women with a history of sexual assault compared with people who had experienced other types of traumatizing events (such as accidents, physical assaults, and war). The eye movement component of the therapy may not be critical for benefit. [ 56 ] [ 221 ] Other approaches, in particular involving social supports, [ 225 ] [ 226 ] may also be important. An open trial of interpersonal psychotherapy reported high rates of remission from PTSD symptoms without using exposure. [ 227 ] Medication Four antidepressants (sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine) have been shown to have a small to modest benefit over placebo. [ 18 ] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may have some benefit for PTSD symptoms. [ 18 ] [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective, but are less well tolerated. [ 230 ] Evidence provides support for a small or modest improvement with sertraline , fluoxetine , paroxetine , and venlafaxine . [ 18 ] [ 231 ] Thus, these four medications are considered to be first-line medications for PTSD. [ 228 ] [ 5 ] The SSRIs paroxetine and sertraline are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of PTSD . [ 36 ] Benzodiazepines are not recommended for the treatment of PTSD due to a lack of evidence of benefit and risk of worsening PTSD symptoms. [ 232 ] Some authors believe that the use of benzodiazepines is contraindicated for acute stress, as this group of drugs can cause dissociation . [ 233 ] Nevertheless, some use benzodiazepines with caution for short-term anxiety and insomnia. [ 234 ] [ 235 ] [ 236 ] While benzodiazepines can alleviate acute anxiety, there is no consistent evidence that they can stop the development of PTSD and may actually increase the risk of developing PTSD 2–5 times. [ 17 ] Benzodiazepines should not be used in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event as they may increase symptoms related to PTSD. [ 36 ] Benzodiazepines may reduce the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions, and there is some evidence that benzodiazepines may actually contribute to the development and chronicity of PTSD. For those who already have PTSD, benzodiazepines may worsen and prolong the course of illness, by worsening psychotherapy outcomes, and causing or exacerbating aggression, depression (including suicidality), and substance use. [ 17 ] Drawbacks include the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence , tolerance (i.e., short-term benefits wearing off with time), and withdrawal syndrome ; additionally, individuals with PTSD (even those without a history of alcohol or drug misuse) are at an increased risk of abusing benzodiazepines . [ 5 ] [ 237 ] Due to several other treatments with greater efficacy for PTSD and fewer risks, benzodiazepines should be considered relatively contraindicated until all other treatment options are exhausted. [ 14 ] [ 238 ] Benzodiazepines also carry a risk of disinhibition (associated with suicidality, aggression and crimes) and their use may delay or inhibit more definitive treatments for PTSD . [ 5 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] Prazosin , an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been used in veterans with PTSD to reduce nightmares. Studies show variability in symptom improvement, appropriate dosages, and efficacy in this population. [ 240 ] [ 241 ] [ 27 ] Glucocorticoids may be useful for short-term therapy to protect against neurodegeneration caused by the extended stress response that characterizes PTSD, but long-term use may actually promote neurodegeneration. [ 242 ] Cannabis is not recommended as a treatment for PTSD because scientific evidence does not currently exist demonstrating treatment efficacy for cannabinoids . [ 243 ] [ 244 ] [ c ] However, use of cannabis or derived products is widespread among U.S. veterans with PTSD. [ 245 ] The cannabinoid nabilone is sometimes used for nightmares in PTSD. Although some short-term benefit was shown, adverse effects are common, and it has not been adequately studied to determine efficacy. [ 246 ] An increasing number of states permit and have legalized the use of medical cannabis for the treatment of PTSD. [ 247 ] Other Physical activity can influence people's psychological [ 248 ] and physical health. [ 249 ] The U.S. National Center for PTSD recommends moderate exercise as a way to distract from disturbing emotions, build self-esteem and increase feelings of being in control again. They recommend a discussion with a doctor before starting an exercise program. [ 250 ] Play is thought to help children link their inner thoughts with their outer world, connecting real experiences with abstract thought. [ 251 ] Repetitive play can also be one way a child relives traumatic events, and that can be a symptom of trauma in a child or young person. [ 252 ] Although it is commonly used, there have not been enough studies comparing outcomes in groups of children receiving and not receiving play therapy , so the effects of play therapy are not yet understood. [ 56 ] [ 251 ] Many veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have faced significant physical, emotional, and relational disruptions. In response, the United States Marine Corps has instituted programs to assist them in re-adjusting to civilian life, especially in their relationships with spouses and loved ones, to help them communicate better and understand what the other has gone through. [ 253 ] Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) developed the Battlemind program to assist service members avoid or ameliorate PTSD and related problems. Wounded Warrior Project partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to create Warrior Care Network , a national health system of PTSD treatment centers. [ 254 ] [ 255 ] In 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted marketing approval for an Apple Watch app called NightWare. The app aims to improve sleep for people suffering from PTSD-related nightmares by vibrating when it detects a nightmare in progress based on monitoring heart rate and body movement. [ 256 ] Epidemiology There is debate over the rates of PTSD found in populations, but, despite changes in diagnosis and the criteria used to define PTSD between 1997 and 2013, epidemiological rates have not changed significantly. [ 258 ] [ 259 ] Most of the current reliable data regarding the epidemiology of PTSD is based on DSM-IV criteria, as the DSM-5 was not introduced until 2013. The United Nations' World Health Organization publishes estimates of PTSD impact for each of its member states; the latest data available are for 2004. Considering only the 25 most populated countries ranked by overall age-standardized Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rate, the top half of the ranked list is dominated by Asian/Pacific countries, the US, and Egypt. [ 257 ] Ranking the countries by the male-only or female-only rates produces much the same result, but with less meaningfulness, as the score range in the single-sex rankings is much-reduced (4 for women, 3 for men, as compared with 14 for the overall score range), suggesting that the differences between female and male rates, within each country, is what drives the distinctions between the countries. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] As of 2017, the cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9%, based on a survey where 5.6% had been exposed to trauma. [ 262 ] The primary factor impacting treatment-seeking behavior, which can help to mitigate PTSD development after trauma was income, while being younger, female, and having less social status (less education, lower individual income, and being unemployed) were all factors associated with less treatment-seeking behavior. [ 262 ] United States PTSD affects about 5% of the US adult population each year. [ 263 ] The National Comorbidity Survey Replication has estimated that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is 6.8%, with women (9.7%) more than twice as likely as men [ 131 ] (3.6%) to have PTSD at some point in their lives. [ 66 ] More than 60% of men and more than 60% of women experience at least one traumatic event in their life. The most frequently reported traumatic events by men are rape, combat, and childhood neglect or physical abuse. Women most frequently report instances of rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened with a weapon, and childhood physical abuse. [ 131 ] 88% of men and 79% of women with lifetime PTSD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. Major depressive disorder, 48% of men and 49% of women, and lifetime alcohol use disorder or dependence, 51.9% of men and 27.9% of women, are the most common comorbid disorders. [ 264 ] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 830,000 Vietnam War veterans had symptoms of PTSD. [ 265 ] The National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study (NVVRS) found 15% of male and 9% of female Vietnam veterans had PTSD at the time of the study. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 31% for males and 27% for females. In a reanalysis of the NVVRS data, along with analysis of the data from the Matsunaga Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde found that, contrary to the initial analysis of the NVVRS data, a large majority of Vietnam veterans had PTSD symptoms (but not the disorder itself). Four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed 20–25 years after Vietnam. [ 266 ] A 2011 study from Georgia State University and San Diego State University found that rates of PTSD diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones, had tours of longer than a year, experienced combat, or were injured. Military personnel serving in combat zones were 12.1 percentage points more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis than their active-duty counterparts in non-combat zones. Those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone were 14.3 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those who had served less than one year. [ 267 ] Experiencing an enemy firefight was associated with an 18.3 percentage point increase in the probability of PTSD, while being wounded or injured in combat was associated with a 23.9 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis. For the 2.16 million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones between 2001 and 2010, the total estimated two-year costs of treatment for combat-related PTSD are between $1.54 billion and $2.69 billion. [ 267 ] As of 2013, rates of PTSD have been estimated at up to 20% for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. [ 268 ] As of 2013 13% of veterans returning from Iraq were unemployed . [ 269 ] The September 11 attacks took the lives of nearly 3,000 people, leaving 6,000 injured. [ 270 ] First responders ( police , firefighters , and emergency medical technicians ), sanitation workers, and volunteers were all involved in the recovery efforts. The prevalence of probable PTSD in these highly exposed populations was estimated across several studies using in-person, telephone, and online interviews and questionnaires . [ 270 ] [ 271 ] [ 272 ] Overall prevalence of PTSD was highest immediately following the attacks and decreased over time. However, disparities were found among the different types of recovery workers. [ 270 ] [ 271 ] The rate of probable PTSD for first responders was lowest directly after the attacks and increased from ranges of 4.8–7.8% to 7.4–16.5% between the 5–6 year follow-up and a later assessment. [ 270 ] When comparing traditional responders to non-traditional responders (volunteers), the probable PTSD prevalence 2.5 years after the initial visit was greater in volunteers, with estimates of 11.7% and 17.2% respectively. [ 270 ] Volunteer participation in tasks atypical to the defined occupational role was a significant risk factor for PTSD. [ 271 ] Other risk factors included exposure intensity, earlier start date, duration of time spent on site, and constant, negative reminders of the trauma. [ 270 ] [ 271 ] Additional research has been performed to understand the social consequences of the September 11 attacks. Alcohol consumption was assessed in a cohort of World Trade Center workers using the cut-annoyed-guilty-eye (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder . Almost 50% of World Trade Center workers who self-identified as alcohol users reported drinking more during the rescue efforts. [ 272 ] Nearly a quarter of these individuals reported drinking more following the recovery. [ 272 ] If determined to have probable PTSD status, the risk of developing an alcohol problem was double compared to those without psychological morbidity . [ 272 ] Social disability was also studied in this cohort as a social consequence of the September 11 attacks. Defined by the disruption of family, work, and social life, the risk of developing social disability increased 17-fold when categorized as having probable PTSD. [ 272 ] Anthropology Cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally. [ 273 ] Trauma (and resulting PTSD) is often experienced through the outermost limits of suffering, pain, and fear. The images and experiences relived through PTSD often defy easy description through language. Therefore, the translation of these experiences from one language to another is problematic, and the primarily Euro-American research on trauma is necessarily limited. [ 274 ] The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that people perceive the world differently according to the language they speak: language and the world it exists within reflect on the perceptions of the speaker. [ 275 ] For example, ethnopsychology studies in Nepal have found that cultural idioms and concepts related to trauma often do not translate to western terminologies: piDaa is a term that may align to trauma/suffering, but also people who suffer from piDaa are considered paagal (mad) and are subject to negative social stigma, indicating the need for culturally appropriate and carefully tailored support interventions. [ 276 ] More generally, different cultures remember traumatic experiences within different linguistic and cultural paradigms. As such, cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), [ needs update ] and constructed through the Euro-American paradigm of psychology. [ 273 ] There remains a dearth of studies into the conceptual frameworks that surround trauma in non-Western cultures. [ 273 ] There is little evidence to suggest therapeutic benefit in synthesizing local idioms of distress into a culturally constructed disorder of the post-Vietnam era, a practice anthropologist believe contributes to category fallacy. [ clarification needed ] [ 273 ] For many cultures, there is no single linguistic corollary to PTSD, psychological trauma being a multi-faceted concept with corresponding variances of expression. [ 276 ] Designating the effects of trauma as an affliction of the spirit is common in many non-Western cultures, where idioms such as \"soul loss\" and \"weak heart\" indicate a preference to confer suffering to a spirit-body or heart-body diametric. These idioms reflect the emphasis that collectivist cultures place on healing trauma through familial, cultural, and religious activities while avoiding the stigma that accompanies a mind-body approach. [ 273 ] Prescribing PTSD diagnostics within these communities is ineffective and often detrimental. [ citation needed ] For trauma that extends beyond the individual, such as the effects of war, anthropologists believe applying the term \"social suffering\" or \" cultural bereavement \" to be more beneficial. [ 277 ] Every facet of society is affected by conflict; the prolonged exposure to mass violence can lead to a 'continuous suffering' among civilians, soldiers, and bordering countries. [ 278 ] Entered into the DSM in 1980, clinicians and psychiatrists based the diagnostic criteria for PTSD around American veterans of the Vietnam War. [ 279 ] Though the DSM gets reviewed and updated regularly, it is unable to fully encompass the disorder due to its Americanization (or Westernization). [ 280 ] That is, what may be considered characteristics of PTSD in Western society may not directly translate across to other cultures around the world. Displaced people of the African country Burundi experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety, though a few symptoms specific to PTSD were noted. [ 281 ] In a similar review, Sudanese refugees relocated in Uganda were 'concerned with material [effects]' (lack of food, shelter, and healthcare), rather than psychological distress. [ 281 ] In this case, many refugees did not present symptoms at all, with a minor few developing anxiety and depression. [ 281 ] War-related stresses and traumas will be ingrained in the individual, [ 278 ] however, they will be affected differently from culture to culture, and the \"clear-cut\" rubric for diagnosing PTSD does not allow for culturally contextual reactions to take place. [ citation needed ] Veterans United States The United States provides a range of benefits for veterans that the VA has determined have PTSD that developed during, or as a result of, their military service. These benefits may include tax-free cash payments, [ 282 ] free or low-cost mental health treatment and other healthcare, [ 283 ] vocational rehabilitation services, [ 284 ] employment assistance, [ 285 ] and independent living support. [ 286 ] [ 287 ] United Kingdom In the UK, there are various charities and service organisations dedicated to aiding veterans in readjusting to civilian life. The Royal British Legion and the more recently established Help for Heroes are two of Britain's more high-profile veterans' organisations, which have actively advocated for veterans over the years. There has been some controversy that the NHS has not done enough in tackling mental health issues and is instead \"dumping\" veterans on charities such as Combat Stress . [ 288 ] [ 289 ] Canada Veterans Affairs Canada provides assistance to disabled veterans that includes rehabilitation, financial aid, job placement, healthcare, disability compensation, peer support , [ 290 ] [ 291 ] and family support. [ 292 ] History Aspects of PTSD in soldiers of ancient Assyria have been identified using written sources from 1300 to 600 BCE. These Assyrian soldiers would undergo a three-year rotation of combat before being allowed to return home, and were reported to have faced immense challenges in reconciling their past actions in war with their civilian lives. [ 293 ] Connections between the actions of Viking berserkers and the hyperarousal of post-traumatic stress disorder have also been drawn. [ 294 ] Psychiatrist Jonathan Shay has proposed that Lady Percy 's soliloquy in the William Shakespeare play Henry IV, Part 1 (act 2, scene 3, lines 40–62 [ 295 ] ), written around 1597, represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of PTSD. [ 296 ] Many historical wartime diagnoses such as railway spine , stress syndrome, nostalgia , soldier's heart, shell shock , battle fatigue , combat stress reaction , and traumatic war neurosis are now associated with PTSD. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The correlations between combat and PTSD are undeniable; according to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and, after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\" [ 299 ] The DSM-I (1952) includes a diagnosis of \"gross stress reaction\", which has similarities to the modern definition and understanding of PTSD. [ 300 ] Gross stress reaction is defined as a normal personality using established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress. [ 301 ] The diagnosis includes language which relates the condition to combat as well as to \"civilian catastrophe\". [ 301 ] The addition of the term to the DSM-III was greatly influenced by the experiences and conditions of U.S. [ 302 ] In fact, much of the available published research regarding PTSD is based on studies done on veterans of the war in Vietnam. Because of the initial overt focus on PTSD as a combat related disorder when it was first fleshed out in the years following the war in Vietnam, in 1975 Ann Wolbert Burgess and Lynda Lytle Holmstrom defined rape trauma syndrome (RTS) to draw attention to the striking similarities between the experiences of soldiers returning from war and of rape victims. [ 303 ] This paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of PTSD. Early in 1978, the diagnosis term \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" was first recommended in a working group finding presented to the Committee of Reactive Disorders. [ 304 ] A USAF study carried out in 1979 focused on individuals (civilian and military) who had worked to recover or identify the remains of those who died in Jonestown . The bodies had been dead for several days, and a third of them had been children. The study used the term \"dysphoria\" to describe PTSD-like symptoms. [ 305 ] After PTSD became an official American psychiatric diagnosis with the publication of DSM-III (1980), the number of personal injury lawsuits ( tort claims) asserting the plaintiff had PTSD increased rapidly. However, triers of fact (judges and juries) often regarded the PTSD diagnostic criteria as imprecise, a view shared by legal scholars, trauma specialists, forensic psychologists , and forensic psychiatrists . The condition was termed \"posttraumatic stress disorder\" in the DSM-III (1980). [ 300 ] [ 304 ] Professional discussions and debates in academic journals, at conferences, and between thought leaders, led to a more clearly defined set of diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV (1994), particularly the definition of a \"traumatic event\". [ 306 ] The DSM-IV classified PTSD under anxiety disorders. In the ICD-10 (first used in 1994), the spelling of the condition was \"post-traumatic stress disorder\". [ 307 ] In 2012, the researchers from the Grady Trauma Project highlighted the tendency people have to focus on the combat side of PTSD: \"less public awareness has focused on civilian PTSD, which results from trauma exposure that is not combat related...\" and \"much of the research on civilian PTSD has focused on the sequelae of a single, disastrous event, such as the Oklahoma City bombing , September 11th attacks , and Hurricane Katrina \". [ 308 ] Disparity in the focus of PTSD research affected the already popular perception of the exclusive interconnectedness of combat and PTSD. This is misleading when it comes to understanding the implications and extent of PTSD as a neurological disorder. The DSM-5 (2013) created a new category called \"trauma and stressor-related disorders\", in which PTSD is now classified. [ 1 ] America's 2014 National Comorbidity Survey reports that \"the traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women.\" [ 66 ] Terminology The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not hyphenate \"post\" and \"traumatic\", thus, the DSM-5 lists the disorder as posttraumatic stress disorder . [ 309 ] However, many scientific journal articles and other scholarly publications do hyphenate the name of the disorder, viz. , \"post-traumatic stress disorder\". [ 310 ] Dictionaries also differ concerning the preferred spelling of the disorder with the Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged using the hyphenated spelling, and the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition and the Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary giving the non-hyphenated spelling. [ 311 ] Some authors have used the terms \" post-traumatic stress syndrome \" or \" post-traumatic stress symptoms \" (\" PTSS \"), [ 312 ] or simply \" post-traumatic stress \" (\" PTS \") in the case of the U.S. Department of Defense , [ 313 ] to avoid stigma associated with the word \"disorder\". The comedian George Carlin criticized the euphemism treadmill which led to progressive change of the way PTSD was referred to over the course of the 20th century, from \" shell shock \" in the First World War to the \"battle fatigue\" in the Second World War , to \"operational exhaustion\" in the Korean War , to the current \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", coined during the Vietnam War , which \"added a hyphen\" and which, he commented, \"completely burie[s] [the pain] under jargon \". He also stated that the name given to the condition has had a direct effect on the way veteran soldiers with PTSD were treated and perceived by civilian populations over time. [ 314 ] Research Most knowledge regarding PTSD comes from studies in high-income countries. [ 315 ] To recapitulate some of the neurological and neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by the veteran population of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, researchers at the Roskamp Institute and the James A Haley Veteran's Hospital (Tampa) have developed an animal model to study the consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PTSD. [ 316 ] In the laboratory, the researchers exposed mice to a repeated session of unpredictable stressor (i.e. predator odor while restrained), and physical trauma in the form of inescapable foot-shock, and this was also combined with a mTBI. In this study, PTSD animals demonstrated recall of traumatic memories , anxiety, and impaired social behavior, while animals subject to both mTBI and PTSD had a pattern of disinhibitory-like behavior. mTBI abrogated both contextual fear and impairments in social behavior seen in PTSD animals. In comparison with other animal studies, [ 316 ] [ 317 ] examination of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune responses in plasma revealed a trend toward increase in corticosterone in PTSD and combination groups. Stellate ganglion block is an experimental procedure for the treatment of PTSD . [ 318 ] Researchers are investigating several experimental FAAH and MAGL-inhibiting drugs in hopes of finding a better treatment for anxiety and stress-related illnesses. [ 319 ] In 2016, the FAAH-inhibitor drug BIA 10-2474 was withdrawn from human trials in France due to adverse effects. [ 320 ] Psychotherapy Trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD (also known as \"exposure-based\" or \"exposure\" psychotherapies), such as prolonged exposure therapy (PE), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and cognitive-reprocessing therapy (CPT) have the most evidence for efficacy and are recommended as first-line treatment for PTSD by almost all clinical practice guidelines. [ 321 ] [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Exposure-based psychotherapies demonstrate efficacy for PTSD caused by different trauma \"types\", such as combat, sexual-assault, or natural disasters. [ 321 ] At the same time, many trauma-focused psychotherapies evince high drop-out rates. [ 324 ] Most systematic reviews and clinical guidelines indicate that psychotherapies for PTSD, most of which are trauma-focused therapies, are more effective than pharmacotherapy (medication), [ 325 ] although there are reviews that suggest exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD and pharmacotherapy are equally effective. [ 326 ] Interpersonal psychotherapy shows preliminary evidence of probable efficacy, but more research is needed to reach definitive conclusions. [ 327 ] A 2021 systematic review of studies found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is an effective treatment for PTSD . [ 16 ] However, on August 9, 2024, the FDA issued a letter stating that a further trial was necessary to ascertain that the benefits of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy outweighed the potential harms. [ 328 ] Positive findings in clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy might be substantially influenced by expectancy effects, given the unblinding of participants. [ 329 ] [ 330 ] To prevent this confounding factor, it has been suggested that future trials compare MDMA against an active placebo. [ 331 ] There is a lack of trials comparing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to existent first-line treatments for PTSD, such as trauma-focused psychological treatments, which seems to achieve similar or even better outcomes than MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

As detailed in another recent WMH report, conditional risk of PTSD after trauma exposure is 4.0%, but varies significantly by trauma type. The highest conditional risk is associated with being raped (19.0%), physical abuse by a romantic partner (11.7%), being kidnapped (11.0%), and being sexually assaulted other than rape (10.5%). In terms of broader categories, the traumas associated with the highest PTSD risk are those involving intimate partner or sexual violence (11.4%), and other traumas (9.2%), with aggregate conditional risk much lower in the other broad trauma categories (2.0–5.4%) [citations omitted; emphasis added]. ^ Darves-Bornoz JM, Alonso J, de Girolamo G, de Graaf R, Haro JM, Kovess-Masfety V, et al.

        "content": "English French Canada [ a ] is a country in North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the second-largest country by total area , with the longest coastline of any country. Its border with the United States is the longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. With a population of over 41 million, it has widely varying population densities, with the majority residing in its urban areas and large areas being sparsely populated. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories resulting in the displacement of Indigenous populations , and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This increased sovereignty was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 , and culminated in the Canada Act 1982 , which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition . The country's head of government is the prime minister , who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is appointed by the governor general , representing the monarch of Canada , the ceremonial head of state . The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and human rights. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration . Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history , economy , and culture . A developed country , Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by nominal GDP , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Recognized as a middle power , Canada's support for multilateralism and internationalism has been closely related to its foreign policies of peacekeeping and aid for developing countries . Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participation in multiple international organizations and forums . Etymology While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata , meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\". [ 9 ] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona . [ 10 ] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); [ 10 ] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada . [ 10 ] From the 16th to the early 18th century, Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River. [ 11 ] Following the British conquest of New France , this area was known as the British Province of Quebec from 1763 to 1791. [ 12 ] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada . These two colonies were collectively referred to as the Canadas until their union as the Province of Canada in 1841. [ 13 ] Upon Confederation in 1867 , Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title. [ 14 ] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\". [ 15 ] The Canada Act 1982 , which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada . Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day . [ 16 ] History Indigenous peoples The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. [ 17 ] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. [ 18 ] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. [ 19 ] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. [ 20 ] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Métis , [ 21 ] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity. [ 21 ] The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 [ 23 ] and two million, [ 24 ] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples . [ 25 ] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. [ 26 ] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases , to which they had no natural immunity, [ 27 ] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency. [ 28 ] Although not without conflict, European Canadians ' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. [ 29 ] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada , particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade . [ 30 ] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties . [ 31 ] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society. [ 32 ] Settler colonialism reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [ 33 ] A period of redress began with the formation of a reconciliation commission by the Government of Canada in 2008. [ 34 ] This included acknowledgment of cultural genocide , [ 35 ] settlement agreements , [ 34 ] and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women . [ 36 ] European colonization It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson . [ 38 ] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland . [ 39 ] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England . [ 40 ] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I . [ 41 ] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. [ 42 ] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia. [ 43 ] In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I , founded St John's, Newfoundland , as the first North American English seasonal camp . [ 44 ] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence. [ 39 ] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). [ 45 ] Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana . [ 46 ] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade. [ 47 ] The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south. [ 48 ] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War . [ 49 ] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. [ 50 ] British North America The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. [ 16 ] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island ) became a separate colony in 1769. [ 52 ] To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley . [ 53 ] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. [ 54 ] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. [ 55 ] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution . [ 16 ] After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. [ 56 ] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists , the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick , as Canada's first city. [ 57 ] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec ) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario ), granting each its own elected legislative assembly. [ 58 ] The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom . Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. [ 60 ] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. [ 61 ] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic -speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances . [ 62 ] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891. [ 23 ] The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837 . [ 63 ] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. [ 16 ] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855. [ 64 ] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute , extending the border westward along the 49th parallel . This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858) . [ 65 ] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border. [ 66 ] Confederation and expansion Following three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario , Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. [ 68 ] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories , where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870. [ 69 ] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, [ 70 ] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. [ 71 ] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905. [ 71 ] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US. [ 72 ] To open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway ), passed the Dominion Lands Act to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory. [ 73 ] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \" Indian reserves \", [ 74 ] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements . [ 75 ] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land. [ 76 ] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands. [ 77 ] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. [ 78 ] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights. [ 79 ] Early 20th century Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War . [ 80 ] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps , which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war. [ 81 ] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. [ 82 ] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, [ 81 ] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931 , affirmed Canada's independence. [ 83 ] The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. [ 84 ] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas ) in the 1940s and 1950s. [ 85 ] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI , seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence. [ 81 ] The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War . [ 86 ] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid , the Allied invasion of Italy , the Normandy landings , the Battle of Normandy , and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. [ 81 ] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany . [ 87 ] Despite another conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944 , Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy. [ 88 ] Contemporary era The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor. [ 89 ] After two referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province. [ 90 ] Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965, [ 91 ] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, [ 92 ] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. [ 93 ] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare , the Canada Pension Plan , and Canada Student Loans ; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions. [ 94 ] Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982 , the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . [ 96 ] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy . [ 97 ] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government. [ 98 ] At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement. [ 99 ] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970, [ 100 ] and the sovereigntist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990. [ 101 ] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West. [ 102 ] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. [ 103 ] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation. [ 101 ] In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history; [ 104 ] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; [ 105 ] and the Oka Crisis of 1990, [ 106 ] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups. [ 107 ] Canada joined the Gulf War in 1990 and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including operations in the Balkans during and after the Yugoslav Wars , [ 108 ] and in Somalia , resulting in an incident that has been described as \" the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military \". [ 109 ] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 , resulting in the largest amount of Canadian deaths for any single military mission since the Korean War in the early 1950s. [ 110 ] In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO -led intervention into the Libyan Civil War [ 111 ] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s. [ 112 ] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, causing widespread social and economic disruption. [ 113 ] In 2021, possible gravesites of Indigenous children were found near former Canadian residential schools , highlighting the cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples . [ 114 ] A trade war involving the United States began on February 1, 2025, when U.S. president Donald Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on goods entering the United States. [ 115 ] Geography By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country . [ 116 ] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth , due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes . [ 117 ] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 square kilometres (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory. [ 118 ] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi). [ 119 ] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States —spanning 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi) [ b ] —Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark ) to the northeast, on Hans Island , [ 120 ] and a maritime boundary with France 's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast. [ 121 ] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert , on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island —latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole. [ 122 ] In latitude, Canada's most northerly point of land is Cape Columbia in Nunavut at 83°6′41″N, with its southern extreme at Middle Island in Lake Erie at 41°40′53″N. In longitude, Canada's land extends from Cape Spear , Newfoundland, at 52°37'W, to Mount St. Elias , Yukon Territory, at 141°W. [ 123 ] Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield , the Interior Plains , the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands , the Appalachian region , the Western Cordillera , Hudson Bay Lowlands , and the Arctic Archipelago . [ 124 ] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains , and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture. [ 118 ] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output. [ 118 ] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water . [ 125 ] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies , the Coast Mountains , and the Arctic Cordillera . [ 126 ] Canada is geologically active , having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes . [ 127 ] Climate Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate , where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F ), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills . [ 128 ] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F). [ 129 ] Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost . The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada . [ 130 ] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948. [ 118 ] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies. [ 131 ] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain , which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity. [ 132 ] Canada is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters globally , [ 133 ] with emissions increased by 16.5 percent between 1990 and 2022. [ 134 ] Biodiversity Canada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones . [ 136 ] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife , with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered. [ 137 ] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries , [ 138 ] due to human activities, invasive species , and environmental issues in the country , there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost . [ 139 ] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\". [ 140 ] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development. [ 141 ] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 square kilometres (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry. [ 142 ] Since the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions . [ 143 ] Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas , including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas . [ 144 ] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas. [ 144 ] Canada's first National Park , Banff National Park was established in 1885. [ 145 ] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park was established in 1893. [ 146 ] Established in 2015, Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area. [ 147 ] Canada's largest national wildlife region, established in 2018, is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area . [ 148 ] Government and politics Canada is described as a \" full democracy \", [ 149 ] with a tradition of liberalism , [ 150 ] and an egalitarian , [ 151 ] moderate political ideology. [ 152 ] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture. [ 153 ] Peace, order, and good government , alongside an Implied Bill of Rights , are founding principles of Canadian federalism . [ 154 ] At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\": [ c ] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada [ 157 ] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors ). [ 158 ] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale. [ 158 ] Five parties had representatives elected to Parliament in the 2025 election —the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition ; the Bloc Québécois ; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left [ 159 ] ); and the Green Party . [ 160 ] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. [ 161 ] Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy —the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative , and judicial branches. [ 162 ] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other sovereign Commonwealth countries [ 163 ] and Canada's 10 provinces . The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general , on the advice of the prime minister , to carry out most of their ceremonial royal duties. [ 164 ] The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada. [ 165 ] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations , [ 166 ] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative ) is otherwise directed by the Cabinet , a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister, [ 167 ] the head of government . To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House. [ 168 ] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown the governor general, lieutenant governors , senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. [ 166 ] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check. [ 169 ] The Parliament of Canada passes all federal statute laws. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate . While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy , this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law . [ 171 ] Each of the 343 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The Constitution Act, 1982 , requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House. [ 172 ] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. [ 173 ] Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. [ 174 ] Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign, have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces, [ 175 ] and differ structurally from their provincial counterparts. [ 176 ] Law The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. [ 177 ] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. [ 178 ] The Statute of Westminster, 1931 , granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982 , ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . [ 179 ] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years. [ 180 ] Canada's judiciary interprets laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since 2017 by Richard Wagner , the Chief Justice of Canada . [ 181 ] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice . [ 182 ] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions. [ 183 ] Common law prevails everywhere except Quebec, where civil law predominates. [ 184 ] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. [ 185 ] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. [ 186 ] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police . [ 187 ] Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada. [ 188 ] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. [ 189 ] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . [ 189 ] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy , and exemption from taxation. [ 190 ] Provinces and territories Canada is a federation composed of 10 federated states , called provinces, and three federal territories . These may be grouped into four main regions : Western Canada , Central Canada , Atlantic Canada , and Northern Canada ( Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). [ 192 ] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare , education , and social programs , [ 193 ] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces. [ 194 ] The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown [ 195 ] and power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 , whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada [ 196 ] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council , [ 197 ] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867 , are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively [ 198 ] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment , while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada. [ 199 ] Foreign relations Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions. [ 201 ] Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, [ 202 ] and for providing aid to developing countries . [ 203 ] Canada and the United States have a long and complex relationship; [ 204 ] historically close allies, they co-operate regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts. [ 205 ] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France , [ 206 ] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie . [ 207 ] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands , owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War . [ 87 ] Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign countries. [ 200 ] Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participating in multiple international organizations . [ 208 ] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations (UN) in 1945 and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command together with the United States in 1958. [ 209 ] The country has membership in the World Trade Organization , the Five Eyes , the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). [ 210 ] The country was a founding member the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in 1989 and joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990. [ 211 ] Canada ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, and seven principal UN human rights conventions and covenants since then. [ 212 ] Military and peacekeeping Alongside many domestic obligations , more than 3,000 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations . [ 214 ] The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy , Canadian Army , and Royal Canadian Air Force . The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\" [ 215 ] —with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers . [ 216 ] [ d ] In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) – placing it 14th for military expenditure by country . [ 218 ] Canada's role in developing peacekeeping and its participation in major peacekeeping initiatives during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image. [ 219 ] Peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the United States. [ 220 ] Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations, [ 221 ] such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 invasion of Iraq . [ 221 ] Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined. [ 222 ] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , rather than directly through the UN. [ 223 ] The change to participation via NATO has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties. [ 224 ] Economy Canada's mixed-market economy [ 226 ] is highly developed , ranking as the world's ninth-largest by nominal GDP as of 2023 [update] , at approximately US$ 2.221 trillion . [ 227 ] The country is one of the world's largest trading nations , with a highly globalized economy. [ 228 ] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion. [ 229 ] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States. [ 229 ] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion. [ 229 ] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization , listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion . [ 230 ] The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country. [ 231 ] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use data from Statistics Canada to enable financial planning and develop economic policy. [ 232 ] Canada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions . [ 233 ] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023) [ 234 ] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\". [ 235 ] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (19th in 2024). [ 236 ] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on the Heritage Foundation 's Index of Economic Freedom [ 237 ] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity . [ 238 ] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average. [ 239 ] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability [ 240 ] and foreign direct investment . [ 241 ] Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing , mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. [ 242 ] The Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry , which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. [ 243 ] Canada has an unusually important primary sector , of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components. [ 244 ] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber. [ 245 ] Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since the Second World War . [ 247 ] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement ). [ 248 ] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries. [ 246 ] Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. [ 249 ] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas , [ 250 ] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. [ 251 ] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third- or fourth-largest . [ 252 ] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products ; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola , and other grains. [ 253 ] Canada's main exports are zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids , aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum , cobalt, and cadmium. [ 254 ] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries. [ 255 ] The country's fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy. [ 256 ] Science and technology In 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development , with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion. [ 257 ] As of 2023 [update] , the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics , chemistry , and medicine . [ 258 ] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals , according to the Nature Index , [ 259 ] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms. [ 260 ] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world , with approximately 95 percent of its population aged 15 and above. [ 261 ] Canada's achievements in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery , [ 263 ] the discovery of insulin , [ 264 ] the development of the polio vaccine , [ 265 ] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus . [ 266 ] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker , mapping the visual cortex , [ 267 ] the development of the electron microscope , [ 268 ] plate tectonics , deep learning , multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole , Cygnus X-1 . [ 269 ] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells , site-directed mutagenesis , T-cell receptor , and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia , cystic fibrosis , and early-onset Alzheimer's disease , among numerous other diseases. [ 270 ] The Canadian Space Agency runs an active space program focused on deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, along with rockets and satellites. [ 271 ] Canada launched its first satellite, Alouette 1 , in 1962. [ 272 ] It contributes to the International Space Station and is known for its robotic tools, such as multiple Canadarms . [ 273 ] Canada has initiated many long-term projects, including the Radarsat satellite series and the Black Brant rocket series . [ 274 ] Demographics The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure. [ 276 ] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023. [ 277 ] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. [ 278 ] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, [ 279 ] driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification . [ 280 ] A record 483,390 immigrants were admitted in 2024. [ 281 ] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement ; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022. [ 282 ] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas , such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. [ 283 ] Canada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world, [ 276 ] with approximately 95 percent of the population residing south of the 55th parallel north. [ 284 ] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States. [ 285 ] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living in urban centres. [ 286 ] The majority of Canadians (over 70 percent ) live below the 49th parallel , with 50 percent of Canadians living south of 45°42′ (45.7 degrees) north. [ 287 ] The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. [ 288 ] The majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and 6.8 percent live with other relatives or unrelated persons. [ 289 ] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households. [ 289 ] v t e Ethnicity Respondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 \" ethnic or cultural origins \". [ 291 ] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European ( 52.5 percent), North American ( 22.9 percent), Asian ( 19.3 percent), North American Indigenous ( 6.1 percent), African ( 3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American ( 2.5 percent), Caribbean ( 2.1 percent), Oceanian ( 0.3 percent), and other ( 6 percent). [ 292 ] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent. [ 291 ] The country's ten largest self-reported ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian [ e ] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent). [ 296 ] Of the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \" White \", representing 69.8 percent of the population. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million people, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021. [ 298 ] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority , [ 299 ] [ f ] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent), Filipinos (960,000 2.6 percent), Arabs (690,000; 1.9 percent), Latin Americans (580,000; 1.6 percent), Southeast Asians (390,000; 1.1 percent), West Asians (360,000; 1.0 percent), Koreans (220,000; 0.6 percent) and Japanese (99,000; 0.3 percent). [ 301 ] Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. [ 302 ] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups. [ 303 ] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent. [ 304 ] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada. [ 305 ] Languages A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages ) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively. [ 289 ] Canada's official bilingualism policies give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official- language minorities guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories. [ 307 ] Quebec's 1974 Official Language Act established French as the only official language of the province. [ 308 ] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick , Alberta , and Manitoba , with Ontario having the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. [ 309 ] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has an Acadian French minority constituting 33 percent of the population. [ 310 ] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island. [ 311 ] Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. [ 312 ] There are 11 Indigenous language groups , composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. [ 313 ] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. [ 314 ] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory. [ 315 ] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their first language . Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890). [ 289 ] The country is also home to many sign languages , some of which are Indigenous. [ 316 ] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools. [ 317 ] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec. [ 318 ] Religion Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. [ 320 ] The Constitution of Canada refers to God; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism . [ 321 ] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right. [ 322 ] Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s. [ 320 ] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, [ 323 ] Canada has become a post-Christian , secular state. [ 324 ] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, [ 325 ] they still believe in God. [ 326 ] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter. [ 327 ] According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population, [ g ] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent. [ 330 ] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent). [ 328 ] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population , behind India . [ 331 ] Health Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care , informally called Medicare . [ 332 ] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984 [ 333 ] and is universal . [ 334 ] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country\". [ 335 ] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector. [ 336 ] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs , dentistry and optometry . [ 336 ] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs. [ 337 ] In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years. [ 289 ] Life expectancy is 81.1 years. [ 338 ] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\". [ 339 ] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use. [ 340 ] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes . [ 340 ] Four chronic diseases— cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases , respiratory diseases , and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. [ 341 ] There are approximately 8 million people aged 15 and older with one or more disabilities in Canada . [ 342 ] In 2024, the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated that healthcare spending reached $372 billion, or 12.4 percent of Canada's GDP for that year. [ 343 ] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD . [ 344 ] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources. [ 345 ] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last. [ 346 ] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage. [ 346 ] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals, [ 347 ] and hospital capacity. [ 348 ] Education Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly , funded and overseen by federal , provincial , and local governments . [ 350 ] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government. [ 351 ] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education , followed by secondary and post-secondary education . Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada. [ 352 ] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. [ 353 ] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada. [ 354 ] The nation's three top ranking universities are the University of Toronto , McGill , and the University of British Columbia . [ 355 ] The largest university is the University of Toronto , which has over 85,000 students. [ 356 ] According to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world; [ 357 ] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree. [ 358 ] Canada spends an average of 5.3 percent of its GDP on education. [ 359 ] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student). [ 360 ] As of 2022 [update] , 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent. [ 361 ] Culture Historically, Canada has been influenced by British , French , and Indigenous cultures and traditions. [ 363 ] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. [ 364 ] Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a just society are constitutionally protected. [ 365 ] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized human rights and inclusiveness for all its people. [ 366 ] Canadian identity shifted from primarily British-based to multicultural between the 1960s and 1970s. [ 367 ] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments [ 368 ] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. [ 369 ] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture. [ 370 ] As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic of regional ethnic subcultures with diverse areas and ethnic enclaves . [ 371 ] Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration , social integration , and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. [ 372 ] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment , strong efforts to eliminate poverty , strict gun control , a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination ) and LGBT rights , and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. [ 373 ] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system , and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [ 374 ] Symbols Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism. [ 376 ] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, northern climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols. [ 377 ] The use of the maple leaf as a symbol dates to the early 18th century in New France. [ 378 ] The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the arms of Canada . [ 379 ] Canada's official tartan, known as the \" maple leaf tartan \", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring , gold in the early autumn , red at the first frost , and brown after falling. [ 380 ] The arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom , with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. [ 381 ] Other prominent symbols include the national motto, \" A mari usque ad mare \" (\"from sea to sea\"), [ 382 ] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse , the beaver , Canada goose , common loon , Canadian horse , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, [ 379 ] and, more recently, the Indigenous totem pole and Inuksuk . [ 383 ] Canadian cuisine items such as Canadian beer , maple syrup , Nanaimo bars , butter tarts , and the Quebec dishes of poutine and tourtière , alongside material items such as tuques , canoes and Hudson's Bay point blanket are considered as uniquely Canadian. [ 384 ] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin , the coat of arms on the 50¢ piece , and the beaver on the nickel . [ 385 ] An image of the monarch appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of coins. [ 385 ] Literature Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. [ 387 ] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration. [ 388 ] This developed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality . [ 389 ] The evolution of Canadian literature is intricately linked to the country's historical and social contexts, often mirroring the challenges and changes in Canadian society. [ 390 ] As Canadian literature progressed into the 20th and 21st centuries, it began to address a broader array of subjects and themes, such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant experiences, environmental issues, the relationship with Indigenous peoples, and Canadian values and identity. [ 391 ] Financial support from governmental bodies, such as the Canada Council for the Arts and various provincial grant programs, facilitates the creation, publication, and promotion of works by Canadian authors . [ 392 ] Numerous Canadian authors have received international literary awards including the Nobel Prize in Literature , the Booker Prize , and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction . [ 393 ] Canadian literary awards and prizes include the Governor General's Literary Awards , the Giller Prize , the Latner Griffin Writers' Trust Poetry Prize , the Burt Award for First Nations, Inuit and Métis Literature and several accolades for literature aimed at children. [ 394 ] Visual arts Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples, [ 396 ] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism. [ 397 ] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada. [ 398 ] The Group of Seven is often considered the first uniquely Canadian artistic group and style of painting. [ 399 ] Inuit art since the 1950s has been the traditional gift given to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government. [ 400 ] Historically, the Catholic Church was the primary patron of art in early Canada, especially Quebec. [ 401 ] The Government of Canada has played a role in the development of art, through the department of Canadian Heritage by giving grants to art galleries, [ 402 ] as well as by establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts. [ 403 ] The Canada Council Art Bank also helps artists by buying and publicizing their work. [ 404 ] Great achievements in art in Canada are recognized through various awards and prizes , such as the Molson Prize , the Audain Prize for the Visual Arts , and the Governor General's Visual and Media Arts Awards . [ 405 ] Music Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes . [ 407 ] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls , chamber halls , conservatories , academies , performing arts centres , record companies , radio stations , and television music video channels. [ 408 ] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music. [ 409 ] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world, [ 410 ] producing internationally renowned composers , musicians , and ensembles . [ 411 ] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC. [ 412 ] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards . [ 413 ] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. [ 414 ] \" God Save the King \" has been used in Canada since the late 1700s and is the country's de facto royal anthem. [ 415 ] Patriotic music by Canadians dates back over 200 years, with \" The Bold Canadian \", written in 1812, popular throughout the 19th century. [ 416 ] \" The Maple Leaf Forever \", written in 1866, was popular and served as an unofficial national anthem of English Canada. [ 417 ] \" O Canada \", originally composed in French in 1880, also served as an unofficial national anthem during the 20th century and was adopted as the country's official anthem in 1980. [ 418 ] Media Canada's media is highly autonomous , uncensored , diverse , and very regionalized. [ 419 ] The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\". [ 420 ] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films , television shows , and magazines —is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. [ 421 ] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). [ 422 ] Canadian mass media , both print and digital , and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \" handful of corporations \". [ 423 ] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. [ 424 ] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec . [ 425 ] Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. [ 426 ] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing. [ 427 ] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising. [ 428 ] Sports Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse . [ 430 ] Other major professional games include curling , basketball , baseball , soccer , and football . [ 431 ] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by numerous \"Halls of Fame\" and museums, such as Canada's Sports Hall of Fame . [ 432 ] Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States. [ 433 ] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League , three Major League Soccer teams, and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association . Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League , National Lacrosse League , the Canadian Premier League , and the curling tournaments hosted by Curling Canada . [ 434 ] Canadians identified hockey as their preferred sport for viewing, followed by soccer and then basketball. [ 435 ] In terms of participation, swimming was the most commonly reported sport by over one-third (35 percent) of Canadians in 2023. [ 436 ] This was closely followed by cycling (33 percent) and running (27 percent). [ 436 ] The popularity of specific sports varies; [ 437 ] in general, the Canadian-born population was more likely to have participated in winter sports such as ice hockey (the most popular young adult team sport), [ 436 ] skating , skiing and snowboarding , compared with immigrants, who were more likely to have played soccer (the most popular youth team sport), [ 438 ] tennis or basketball. [ 436 ] Sports such as golf , volleyball , badminton , bowling , and martial arts are also widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels. [ 439 ] Canada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics [ 440 ] —particularly the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics , [ 441 ] the 1988 Winter Olympics , [ 442 ] the 2010 Winter Olympics , [ 443 ] the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup , [ 444 ] the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games . [ 445 ] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.

Canada's experience can be divided into three phases: 1) Judicially implied rights; 2) Legislatively protected rights; and 3) Constitutionally protected human rights. Before human rights legislation and the Charter, courts in Canada relied on the theory of an \"implied bill of rights\" to protect traditional civil liberties such as freedom of speech and association. The theoretical foundation for these rights was the importance of free political speech and discussion in a democracy. Dixon, John; P. ISBN 978-1-317-36677-5 . Boughey, Janina (2017).

        "title": "Automated external defibrillator - Wikipedia",
        "content": "An automated external defibrillator ( AED ) is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia , [ 1 ] and is able to treat them through defibrillation , the application of electricity which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm. With simple audio and visual commands, AEDs are designed to be simple to use for the layperson, and the use of AEDs is taught in many first aid , certified first responder , and basic life support (BLS) level cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) classes. [ 2 ] The portable version of the defibrillator was invented in the mid-1960s by Frank Pantridge in Belfast , Northern Ireland and the first automatic, public-use defibrillator was produced by the Cardiac Resuscitation Company in the late 1970s. The unit was launched under the name Heart-Aid. [ 3 ] Indications Conditions that the device treats An automated external defibrillator is used in cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias which lead to sudden cardiac arrest , which is not the same as a heart attack. The rhythms that the device will treat are usually limited to: Pulseless Ventricular tachycardia (shortened to VT or V-Tach) [ 1 ] Ventricular fibrillation (shortened to VF or V-Fib) In each of these two types of shockable cardiac arrhythmia , the heart is electrically active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and circulate blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole . AEDs, like all defibrillators, are not designed to shock asystole ('flat line' patterns) as this will not have a positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator. Effect of delayed treatment Uncorrected, these cardiac conditions (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole) rapidly lead to irreversible brain damage and death, once cardiac arrest takes place. After approximately three to five minutes in cardiac arrest, [ 4 ] irreversible brain/tissue damage may begin to occur. For every minute that a person in cardiac arrest goes without being successfully treated (by defibrillation), the chance of survival decreases by 7 percent per minute in the first three minutes, and decreases by 10 percent per minute as time advances beyond ~three minutes. [ 5 ] Requirements for use AEDs are designed to be used by laypersons who may not have received AED training. However, sixth-grade students have been reported to begin defibrillation within 90 seconds, as opposed to a trained operator beginning within 67 seconds. [ 6 ] This is in contrast to more sophisticated manual and semi-automatic defibrillators used by health professionals, which can act as a pacemaker if the heart rate is too slow ( bradycardia ) and perform other functions which require a skilled operator able to read electrocardiograms . Bras with a metal underwire and piercings on the torso must be removed before using the AED on someone to avoid interference. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The American television show MythBusters found evidence that use of a defibrillator on a woman wearing an underwire bra can lead to arcing or fire but only in unusual and unlikely circumstances. [ 9 ] In a study analyzing the effects of having AEDs immediately present during Chicago's Heart Start program over a two-year period, of 22 individuals, 18 were in a cardiac arrhythmia which AEDs can treat. Of these 18, 11 survived. Of these 11 patients, 6 were treated by bystanders with absolutely no previous training in AED use. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Implementation Placement and availability Automated external defibrillators are generally either kept where health professionals and first responders can use them (health facilities and ambulances) as well as public access units which can be found in public places including corporate and government offices, shopping centres, restaurants, hotels, public transport, and any other location where people may congregate. In order to make them highly visible, public access AEDs are often brightly coloured and are mounted in protective cases near the entrance of a building. When these protective cases are opened or the defibrillator is removed, some will sound a buzzer to alert nearby staff to their removal, though this does not necessarily summon emergency services; trained AED operators should know to phone for an ambulance when sending for or using an AED. In September 2008, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation issued a 'universal AED sign' to be adopted throughout the world to indicate the presence of an AED, and this is shown on the right. [ 12 ] A trend that is developing is the purchase of AEDs to be used in the home, particularly by those with known existing heart conditions. [ 13 ] The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels. There has been some concern among medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have appropriate training, [ 14 ] and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed. Typically, an AED kit will contain a face shield for providing a barrier between patient and first aider during rescue breathing; a pair of nitrile rubber gloves; a pair of trauma shears for cutting through a patient's clothing to expose the chest; a small towel for wiping away any moisture on the chest, and a razor for shaving those with very hairy chests. [ 15 ] Preparation for operation Most manufacturers recommend checking the AED before every period of duty or on a regular basis for fixed units. Some units need to be switched on in order to perform a self check; other models have a self check system built in with a visible indicator. All manufacturers mark their electrode pads with an expiration date, and it is important to ensure that the pads are in date. The typical life expectancy of AED pads are between 18 and 30 months. [ 16 ] This is usually marked on the outside of the pads. Some models are designed to make this date visible through a 'window', although others will require the opening of the case to find the date stamp. [ 17 ] It is also important to ensure that the AED unit's batteries have not expired. The AED manufacturer will specify how often the batteries should be replaced. Each AED has a different recommended maintenance schedule outlined in the user manual. Common checkpoints on every checklist, however, also include a monthly check of the battery power by checking the green indicator light when powered on, condition and cleanliness of all cables and the unit, and check for the adequate supplies. [ 18 ] Mechanism of operation An AED is \"automatic\" because of the unit's ability to autonomously analyse the patient's condition. To assist this, the vast majority of units have spoken prompts, and some may also have visual displays to instruct the user. \"External\" refers to the fact that the operator applies the electrode pads to the bare chest of the victim (as opposed to internal defibrillators , which have electrodes surgically implanted inside the body of a patient). When turned on or opened, the AED will instruct the user to connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient. Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient so as to avoid false readings by the unit. The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. The device system is not only safer - charging only when required, but also allows for a faster delivery of the electric current. When charged, the device instructs the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and then to press a button to deliver the shock; human intervention is usually required to deliver the shock to the patient in order to avoid the possibility of accidental injury to another person (which can result from a responder or bystander touching the patient at the time of the shock). Depending on the manufacturer and particular model, after the shock is delivered most devices will analyze the patient and either instruct CPR to be performed, or prepare to administer another shock. Many AED units have an 'event memory' which store the ECG of the patient along with details of the time the unit was activated and the number and strength of any shocks delivered. Some units also have voice recording abilities [ 19 ] to monitor the actions taken by the personnel in order to ascertain if these had any impact on the survival outcome. All this recorded data can be either downloaded to a computer or printed out so that the providing organisation or responsible body is able to see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation. Some AED units even provide feedback on the quality of the compressions provided by the rescuer. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The first commercially available AEDs were all of a monophasic type, which gave a high-energy shock, up to 360 to 400 joules depending on the model. This caused increased cardiac injury and in some cases second and third-degree burns around the shock pad sites. Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120–200 joules, with each shock moving in an opposite polarity between the pads. Others may give a stepped approach to energy delivery, usually in a 200J, a second 200J, then 300J, and finally 360J shock, with any further shocks also being 360 Joules. This lower-energy waveform has proven more effective in clinical tests, as well as offering a reduced rate of complications and reduced recovery time. [ 22 ] Usage Simplicity of use Unlike regular defibrillators , an automated external defibrillator (AED) requires minimal training to be used (or even no training). That is possible because all AEDs approved for use in the United States and many other countries use an electronic voice to prompt users through each step. Many AEDs now include visual prompts in case of a hearing impaired user. Most units are designed for use by non-medical operators. Their ease of use has given rise to the notion of public access defibrillation (PAD). An AED automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. Automatic models will administer the shock without the user's command. Semi-automatic models will tell the user that a shock is needed, but the user must tell the machine to do so, usually by pressing a button. In most circumstances, the user cannot override a \"no shock\" advisory by an AED. Some AEDs may be used on children – those under 55 lbs (25 kg) in weight or under age 8. If a particular model of AED is approved for pediatric use, all that is required is the use of more appropriate pads [ failed verification ] . [ 23 ] Benefit Observational studies have shown that in out of hospital cardiac arrest, public access defibrillators when used were associated with 40% median survival. When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival. [ 24 ] Liability Automated external defibrillators are now easy enough to use that most states in the United States include the \"good faith\" use of an AED by any person under Good Samaritan laws . [ 25 ] \"Good faith\" protection under a Good Samaritan law means that a volunteer responder (not acting as a part of one's occupation) cannot be held civilly liable for the harm or death of a victim by providing improper or inadequate care, given that the harm or death was not intentional and the responder was acting within the limits of their training and in good faith. In the United States, Good Samaritan laws provide some protection for the use of AEDs by trained and untrained responders. [ 26 ] AEDs create little liability if used correctly; [ 27 ] NREMT-B and many state Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training and many CPR classes incorporate or offer AED education as a part of their program. In addition to Good Samaritan laws, Ontario, Canada also has the \" Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability), 2007 (Bill 171 – Subsection N)\", passed in June, 2007, [ 28 ] which protects individuals from liability for damages that may occur from their use of an AED to save someone's life at the immediate scene of an emergency unless damages are caused by gross negligence. Legislation in Australia varies by state, with separate liability issues relating to providing and using AED equipment. Each state and territory has enacted \"Good Samaritan\" laws that offer legal protection to a person who gives assistance in a medical emergency - the standard of care expected corresponds to their training (or lack of training). [ 29 ] In New South Wales, the Work Health and Safety Regulation (2011) requires an employer to use a risk assessment to ensure that there is adequate provision for first aid; when there is a sufficient risk it warrants providing a defibrillator. [ 30 ] Reliability In 2012, AED's (automated external defibrillators) were under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which considered reclassifying AEDs as class III premarket approval devices. Technical malfunctions likely contributed to more than 750 deaths in the 5-year period between 2004 and 2009, in most cases by component failures or design errors. During the same period, up to 70 types of AEDs were recalled, including recalls from every AED manufacturer in the world. [ 31 ] In January and February 2015, the FDA issued this news release: \"The FDA issued a final order that will require AED manufacturers to submit premarket approval applications (PMAs), which undergo a more rigorous review than what was required to market these devices in the past. The agency's strengthened review will focus on the critical requirements needed to ensure the safety and reliability of AEDs and their necessary accessories, including batteries, pad electrodes, adapters and hardware keys for pediatric use.\" [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In the United Kingdom there is concern that poor maintenance may make public defibrillators unreliable. Regular inspections and readiness checks are essential to maintaining AED effectiveness over time. The Henley Standard reported on 21 July 2017 that more than half the defibrillators in Henley-on-Thames and the surrounding area were at risk of failing, either because of low battery power or because adhesive pads had deteriorated. History The first use of an external defibrillator on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck. [ 34 ] The portable version of the external defibrillator was invented in 1957 by Frank Pantridge in Belfast , Northern Ireland , a pioneer in emergency medical treatment. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Pantridge's defibrillator required a trained operator to perform the shock procedure and charted a course for many new innovations in external defibrillation. [ 37 ] In the late 1970s the Heart-Aid was developed as the first truly automated external defibrillator that was designed for the public. The principles of ABC assessment and a human voice relaying instructions helped bystanders respond to a sudden cardiac event while waiting for the first responders to get to scene. [ 3 ] Many of the early innovations in the Heart-Aid model are still part of the current generation of AEDs, although some innovations, like the airway electrode have fallen from use. Case studies In a study published in 2017, researchers in Poland selected the main entrances of buildings which had AEDs, although the researchers themselves did not know the exact locations of the devices. In mock cardiac arrest scenarios, the average time to bring the AED to the patient was 96 seconds, with a time that ranged from 52 to 144 seconds. This met the three minute goal. In some cases, the use of the AED required the continuous presence of building personnel. Future improvements include more obvious signage and public-access AEDs which do not require a staff member of the building to either retrieve or use the device.

Set in the mid-1970s, it details a group of white anti-apartheid activists seeking to overthrow the South African government. It follows the life of Rosa Burger as she comes to terms with her father's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party . Gordimer was involved in South African politics and knew Bram Fischer , Nelson Mandela 's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the novel's Burger family on Fischer's family and described Burger's Daughter as an homage to Fischer. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom in 1979. It was banned in South Africa a month after its publication, and its import and sale were prohibited by the South African Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the ban and restrictions were lifted.

armed conflict [ a ] between the armed forces of states , or between governmental forces and armed groups that are organized under a certain command structure and have the capacity to sustain military operations , or between such organized groups. [ 2 ] It is generally characterized by widespread violence , destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces . Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. [ 3 ] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets , and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties . Etymology The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre and werre , from Old French werre ( guerre as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish * werra , ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic * werzō ' mixture, confusion ' . The word is related to the Old Saxon werran , Old High German werran , and the modern German verwirren , meaning ' to confuse, to perplex, to bring into confusion ' . [ 4 ] History Anthropologists disagree about whether warfare was common throughout human prehistory, or whether it was a more recent development, following the invention of agriculture or organised states. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] It is difficult to determine whether warfare occurred during the Paleolithic due to the sparseness of known remains. Some sources claim that most Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies were possibly fundamentally egalitarian [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and may have rarely or never engaged in organized violence between groups (i.e. war). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Evidence of violent conflict appears to increase during the Mesolithic period, from around 10,000 years ago onwards. [ 5 ] Raymond Case Kelly , a cultural anthropologist and ethnologist from the US, claimed that before 400,000 years ago, groups of people clashed like groups of chimpanzees, however, later they preferred \"positive and peaceful social relations between neighboring groups, such as joint hunting, trading, and courtship.\" [ 18 ] In his book \"Warless Societies and the Origin of War\" he explores the origins of modern wars and states that high surplus product encourages conflict, so \"raiding often begins in the richest environments\". [ 19 ] In War Before Civilization , Lawrence H. Keeley , a professor at the University of Illinois , says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, [ 20 ] and many fought constantly. [ 21 ] Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids , large raids, and massacres . All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. [ 22 ] Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids. [ 23 ] William Rubinstein wrote \"Pre-literate societies, even those organized in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty.'\" [ 24 ] Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, [ 25 ] military activity has continued over much of the globe. In Europe the oldest known battlefield is thought to date to 1250 BC. [ 26 ] The Bronze Age has been described as a key period in the intensification of warfare, with the emergence of dedicated warriors and the development of metal weapons like swords. [ 27 ] Two other commonly named periods of increase are the Axial Age and Modern Times. [ 28 ] The invention of gunpowder , and its eventual use in warfare, together with the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to war itself. In Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992 , Charles Tilly , professor of history, sociology, and social science at the University of Michigan and the Columbia University, described as \"the founding father of 21st-century sociology\" [ 29 ] argued that ‘War made the state, and the state made war,’ saying that wars have led to creation of states which in their turn perpetuate war. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Tilly's theory of state formation is considered dominant in the state formation literature. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Since 1945, great power wars, interstate wars, [ 35 ] territorial conquests and war declarations have declined in frequency . [ 36 ] Wars have been increasingly regulated by international humanitarian law . [ 36 ] Battle deaths and casualties have declined, in part due to advances in military medicine [ 37 ] and despite advances in weapons. In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place, but no battle has taken place since 1945. [ 38 ] However, war in some aspects has not necessarily declined. [ 36 ] Civil wars have increased in absolute terms since 1945. [ 36 ] A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies. [ 39 ] The major exceptions were the Korean War , the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 , the Iran–Iraq War , the Gulf War , the Eritrean–Ethiopian War , and the Russo-Ukrainian War . Types of warfare Asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or size. [ 40 ] Biological warfare , or germ warfare, is the use of biological infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria , viruses , and fungi against people, plants, or animals. This can be conducted through sophisticated technologies, like cluster munitions , [ 41 ] or with rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind enemy lines, [ 42 ] and can include weaponized or non-weaponized pathogens. Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I , and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians. [ 43 ] Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic warfare , political warfare , covert operations , espionage , cyberwarfare , or proxy wars . Conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which nuclear , biological , chemical or radiological weapons are not used or see limited deployment. Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems. Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, where irregular forces take up arms to change an existing political order. An insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency , and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime. Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation). [ 44 ] Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation. Radiological warfare is any form of warfare involving deliberate radiation poisoning or contamination of an area with radiological sources. Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of war , placing no limits on legitimate military targets , using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties , or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population. Unconventional warfare can be defined as \"military and quasi-military operations other than conventional warfare \" [ 45 ] and may use covert forces or actions such as subversion , diversion , sabotage , espionage , biowarfare , sanctions , propaganda or guerrilla warfare . Aims Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve. [ 46 ] Definition Fried defines war aims as \"the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war\". [ 47 ] Classification Tangible/intangible aims: Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the Anglo-Dutch Wars ). Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation [ 48 ] – may have more tangible expression (\"conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power\"). [ 49 ] Explicit/implicit aims: Explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions. Implicit war aims [ 50 ] can take the form of minutes of discussion, memoranda and instructions. [ 51 ] Positive/negative aims: \"Positive war aims\" cover tangible outcomes. \"Negative war aims\" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes. [ 52 ] War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into \"peace conditions\" [ 53 ] – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war. Effects Conflict zones When a war takes place, one or more areas within a country or across border becomes a war zone or conflict zone. Daily life is interrupted, travel to or across the area may be difficult and international visitors may be advised to leave the area. [ 55 ] Casualties Estimates for total deaths due to war vary widely. In one estimate, primitive warfare from 50,000 to 3000 BCE has been thought to have claimed 400 million±133,000 victims based on the assumption that it accounted for the 15.1% of all deaths. [ 57 ] Ian Morris estimated that the rate could be as high as 20%. [ 58 ] Other scholars find the prehistoric percentage much lower, around 2%, similar to the Neanderthals and ancestors of apes and primates. [ 59 ] For the period 3000 BCE until 1991, estimates range from 151 million [ 60 ] to several billion. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The lowest estimate for history of 151 million was calculated by William Eckhardt. He explained his method as summing the recorded casualties and multiplying their average by the number of recorded battles or wars. This method excludes indirect deaths for premodern wars and all deaths for unrecorded wars. Few premodern wars were recorded beyond Eurasia and only 18 wars were recorded for period 3000 - 1500 BC worldwide. [ 63 ] Later researches shifted from Eckhardt's approach to general estimations of the percentage of population killed by wars. Azar Gat and Ian Morris both give the lowest estimate of 1% for history including all the 20th century, [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] or about 1 billion. [ 67 ] The highest estimates of both scholars exceed the famous \"hoax\" of 3,640,000,000 people killed in wars which circulated decades in scholarly literature in various countries. [ 68 ] Gat gives 5%, [ 69 ] or about 5 billion. [ 70 ] Morris gives for the 20th century 2%, for 1400-1900 3% in Europe and \"slightly higher\" elsewhere, 5% for the ancient empires in 500 BC - AD 200, 10% for the rest of history and 20% for prehistory. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] His total for history is thus about 9 billion. [ 73 ] Largest wars by death toll The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is World War II , from 1939 to 1945, with 70–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests [ 74 ] at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties ). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. [ 75 ] War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine , large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). [ 79 ] Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, [ 80 ] and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers . [ 81 ] Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II , or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls. [ 82 ] On military personnel Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder , disease, injury, and death. In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire. — No More Heroes , Richard Gabriel [ 38 ] Swank and Marchand's World War II study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders. [ 95 ] One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees. — 14–18: Understanding the Great War , Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker [ 38 ] Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder . [ 95 ] Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War , including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South. [ 96 ] The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I , 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. [ 97 ] During Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians. [ 98 ] Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action. [ 99 ] In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the Seven Years' War , the Royal Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were 'missing'. [ 100 ] It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war. [ 101 ] On civilians Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine , disease, and death in the civilian population ). During the Thirty Years' War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide , while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. War also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes. A medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3.3%. Additionally, about 1.8% of the population loses access to drinking water . [ 104 ] Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of whom were civilians. [ 105 ] Deaths in the Soviet Union were around 27 million . [ 106 ] Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been. [ 107 ] Economic Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions. [ 108 ] Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II . Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery, though it did help in reducing unemployment. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] In most cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War , and World War I , warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917 . [ 113 ] World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the war effort (as adjusted to 1940 prices). [ 114 ] [ 115 ] The Great Depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials. [ 116 ] By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed. [ 117 ] Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries. [ 118 ] Theories of motivation There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common. [ 119 ] Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said, \"Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.\" [ 120 ] Psychoanalytic Dutch psychoanalyst Joost Meerloo held that, \"War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.\" [ 121 ] Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent. [ 122 ] This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races , religions , nations or ideologies . By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari , a follower of Melanie Klein , thought war was the paranoid or projective \"elaboration\" of mourning. [ 123 ] Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \"love need\": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation. Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace. [ 124 ] Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. [ 125 ] He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler . Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war. Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country. — Hermann Göring at the Nuremberg trials , 18 April 1946 [ 126 ] Evolutionary Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition. [ 127 ] The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees , [ 128 ] as well as in many ant species, [ 129 ] group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states. [ 130 ] Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory. [ b ] He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (\" honor \"). [ b ] Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which \"coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups\", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking \"tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors\". [ 132 ] Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. [ 133 ] Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the Chewong and Semai of the Malay peninsula. [ 134 ] Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive. [ 135 ] Economic War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth. War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity . [ 136 ] While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.S. Generals , expressed support for an economic view of war. Marxist The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ( imperialist ) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism . Marxist economists Karl Kautsky , Rosa Luxemburg , Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets . Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand . Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism. [ 139 ] Demographic Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories: Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict. Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade , advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said: For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. [ 140 ] This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine . [ 141 ] The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria , Mali , Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] According to Heinsohn , who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the \"fighting age\" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Heinsohn saw both past \"Christianist\" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. [ 147 ] Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789, [ 148 ] and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. [ 149 ] The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge. [ 150 ] Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, [ 151 ] Population Action International , [ 152 ] and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development . [ 153 ] Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination. [ 154 ] Cultural Geoffrey Parker argues that what distinguishes the \"Western way of war\" based in Western Europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500: The Western way of war rests upon five principal foundations: technology, discipline, a highly aggressive military tradition, a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and – from about 1500 onward – a unique system of war finance. The combination of all five provided a formula for military success....The outcome of wars has been determined less by technology, then by better war plans, the achievement of surprise, greater economic strength, and above all superior discipline. [ 155 ] Parker argues that Western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline, that is, \"the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy, where they're attacking or being attacked, without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic.\" Discipline came from drills and marching in formation, target practice, and creating small \"artificial kinship groups: such as the company and the platoon, to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency. [ 156 ] Rationalist Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework. Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations) ) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. [ 157 ] Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain , would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game , optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In \"Rationalist Explanations for War\", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war: Issue indivisibilities Incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry Commitment problems [ 157 ] \"Issue indivisibility\" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other. \" Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent\" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, \"war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.\" [ 158 ] Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments. [ 159 ] Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias , [ 160 ] but are still \"as rational as you and me\". [ 161 ] According to philosopher Iain King , \"Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....\" [ 162 ] King asserts that \"Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink \" which is faulty, but still rational. [ 163 ] The rationalist theory focused around bargaining, which is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars. [ 164 ] Political science The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I . More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program . [ 165 ] The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often used by political scientists since then. [ 166 ] : 143 There are several different international relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma . [ 166 ] : 145 Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau , and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer , two main sub-theories are: Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and \"movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing.\" [ 166 ] : 147 However, evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars. [ 166 ] : 147–48 Power transition theory : Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to pre-emptively suppress them. [ 166 ] : 148 On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more equally distributed. This \"power preponderance\" hypothesis has empirical support. [ 166 ] : 148 The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance. [ 166 ] : 148 Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations. Critics respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. [ 166 ] : 149 Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict. [ 166 ] : 150 Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with each other. [ 166 ] : 150 Diversionary theory , also known as the \"scapegoat hypothesis\", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support. [ 166 ] : 152 This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding , and a significant domestic \"rally effect\" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin. [ 166 ] : 152–13 However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed. [ 166 ] : 152–53 U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory. [ 167 ] These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand. [ 166 ] : 157 For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases , [ 166 ] : 157 such as prospect theory . [ 168 ] Ethics The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years. [ 169 ] The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory , are jus ad bellum and jus in bello . [ 170 ] Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. [ 174 ] The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. [ 174 ] Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent. [ 175 ] The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in international law 's regulations on legitimate war. [ 169 ] Lewis Coser, an American conflict theorist and sociologist, argued that conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society. [ 176 ] Limiting and stopping Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes : \"Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation.\" [ 177 ] Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I , World War II , and the Vietnam War . In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq . Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Pauses During a war, the parties may agree to pauses. A ceasefire is a stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions (often due to mediation by a third party). [ 178 ] Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. [ 179 ] A ceasefire can be temporary with an intended end date or may be intended to last indefinitely. A ceasefire is distinct from an armistice in that the armistice is a formal end to a war whereas a ceasefire may be a temporary stoppage. [ 180 ] The immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary. Ceasefires may be intended to meet short-term limited needs (such as providing humanitarian aid), manage a conflict to make it less devastating, or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute. [ 181 ] An actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict (for example, by re-arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary), which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented. [ 182 ] [ 181 ] [ 183 ] The durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors, such as demilitarized zones, withdrawal of troops and third-party guarantees and monitoring (e.g. peacekeeping ). Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack, reduce uncertainty about the adversary's intentions, and when mechanisms are put in place to prevent accidents from spiraling into conflict. [ 182 ] See also Outline of war Notes ^ The term \"armed conflict\" is used instead of, or in addition to, the term \"war\" with the former being more general in scope. The International Committee of the Red Cross differentiates between international and non-international armed conflict in their definition, \"International armed conflicts exist whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States.... Non-international armed conflicts are protracted armed confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the forces of one or more armed groups, or between such groups arising on the territory of a State [party to the Geneva Conventions]. The armed confrontation must reach a minimum level of intensity and the parties involved in the conflict must show a minimum of organisation.\" [ 1 ] ^ a b The argument is made from pages 314 to 332 of The Blank Slate . [ 131 ] Relevant quotes include on p332 \"The first step in understanding violence is to set aside our abhorrence of it long enough to examine why it can sometimes pay off in evolutionary terms.\", \"Natural selection is powered by competition, which means that the products of natural selection – survival machines, in Richard Dawkins metaphor – should, by default, do whatever helps them survive and reproduce.\". On p323 \"If an obstacle stands in the way of something an organism needs, it should neutralize the obstacle by disabling or eliminating it.\", \"Another human obstacle consists of men monopolozing women who could otherwise be taken as wives.\", \"The competition can be violent\". On p324 \"So people have invented, and perhaps evolved, an alternate defense: the advertised deterrence policy known as lex talionis , the law of retaliation, familiar from the biblical injunction \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\" If you can credibly say to potential adversaries, \"We won't attack first, but if we are attacked, we will survive and strike back,\" you remove Hobbes's first two incentives for quarrel, gain and mistrust.\". On p326 \"Also necessary for vengeance to work as a deterrent is that the willingness to pursue it be made public, because the whole point of deterrence is to give would-be attackers second thoughts beforehand . And this brings us to Hobbes's final reason for quarrel. Thirdly, glory – though a more accurate word would be \"honor\".\" References ^ \"How is the Term \"Armed Conflict\" Defined in International Humanitarian Law?\" (PDF) .

Intangibles, such as prestige or power, can also represent war aims, though often (albeit not always) their achievement is framed within a more tangible context (e.g. conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power, etc.). ^ Compare: Katwala, Sunder (13 February 2005). \"Churchill by Paul Addison\" .

[Churchill] took office and declared he had 'not become the King's First Minister to oversee the liquidation of the British empire'. [...] His view was that an Anglo-American English-speaking alliance would seek to preserve the empire, though ending it was among Roosevelt's implicit war aims. ^ Compare Fried, Marvin Benjamin (1 July 2014). At times, war aims were explicitly stated internally or externally in a policy decision, while at other times [...] the war aims were merely discussed but not published, remaining instead in the form of memoranda or instructions. ^ Fried, Marvin Benjamin (1 July 2015). \" 'A Life and Death Question': Austro-Hungarian War Aims in the First World War\" .

        "title": "Injury - Wikipedia",
        "content": "Injury is physiological damage to the living tissue of any organism, whether in humans , in other animals , or in plants . Injuries can be caused in many ways, including mechanically with penetration by sharp objects such as teeth or with blunt objects , by heat or cold, or by venoms and biotoxins . Injury prompts an inflammatory response in many taxa of animals; this prompts wound healing . In both plants and animals, substances are often released to help to occlude the wound, limiting loss of fluids and the entry of pathogens such as bacteria. Many organisms secrete antimicrobial chemicals which limit wound infection; in addition, animals have a variety of immune responses for the same purpose. Both plants and animals have regrowth mechanisms which may result in complete or partial healing over the injury. Cells too can repair damage to a certain degree. Taxonomic range Animals Injury in animals is sometimes defined as mechanical damage to anatomical structure, [ 1 ] but it has a wider connotation of physical damage with any cause, including drowning , burns , and poisoning . [ 2 ] Such damage may result from attempted predation , territorial fights, falls, and abiotic factors. [ 2 ] Injury prompts an inflammatory response in animals of many different phyla ; [ 3 ] this prompts coagulation of the blood or body fluid, [ 4 ] followed by wound healing , which may be rapid, as in the cnidaria . [ 3 ] Arthropods are able to repair injuries to the cuticle that forms their exoskeleton to some extent. [ 5 ] Animals in several phyla, including annelids , arthropods, cnidaria, molluscs , nematodes , and vertebrates are able to produce antimicrobial peptides to fight off infection following an injury. [ 1 ] Injury in humans has been studied extensively for its importance in medicine . Much of medical practice, including emergency medicine and pain management , is dedicated to the treatment of injuries. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The World Health Organization has developed a classification of injuries in humans by categories including mechanism, objects/substances producing injury, place of occurrence, activity when injured and the role of human intent. [ 8 ] In addition to physical harm, injuries can cause psychological harm, including post-traumatic stress disorder . [ 9 ] Plants In plants, injuries result from the eating of plant parts by herbivorous animals including insects and mammals , [ 10 ] from damage to tissues by plant pathogens such as bacteria and fungi , which may gain entry after herbivore damage or in other ways, [ 11 ] and from abiotic factors such as heat, [ 12 ] freezing, [ 13 ] flooding, [ 14 ] lightning, [ 15 ] and pollutants [ 16 ] such as ozone. [ 17 ] Plants respond to injury by signalling that damage has occurred, [ 18 ] by secreting materials to seal off the damaged area, [ 19 ] by producing antimicrobial chemicals, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and in woody plants by regrowing over wounds. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Cell injury Cell injury is a variety of changes of stress that a cell suffers due to external as well as internal environmental changes. Amongst other causes, this can be due to physical, chemical, infectious, biological, nutritional or immunological factors. Cell damage can be reversible or irreversible. Depending on the extent of injury, the cellular response may be adaptive and where possible, homeostasis is restored. [ 25 ] Cell death occurs when the severity of the injury exceeds the cell's ability to repair itself. [ 26 ] Cell death is relative to both the length of exposure to a harmful stimulus and the severity of the damage caused. [ 25 ] References ^ a b Rennolds, Corey W.; Bely, Alexandra E.

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage",
        "title": "Bandage - Wikipedia",
        "content": "A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint , or on its own to provide support for the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage is used to hold the dressing in place. Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages, which are used to reduce swellings or to provide support to a sprained joint. Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily. Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specially shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body. Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material. In American English , the word bandage is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage . Types Gauze bandage (common gauze roller bandage) The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa [ clarification needed ] absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place. Adhesive bandage Liquid bandage Compression bandage The term \"compression bandage\" refers to a wide variety of bandages with many different applications: Short stretch compression bandages are applied to a limb (usually for treatment of lymphedema or venous ulcers ). [ citation needed ] This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for long-term treatment. Conversely, the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure. Long stretch compression bandages have long stretch properties, meaning that their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. However, they also have a very high resting pressure and must be removed at night or if the patient is in a resting position. Triangular bandage Also known as a cravat bandage, a triangular bandage is a piece of cloth put into a right-angled triangle, and often provided with safety pins to secure it in place. It can be used fully unrolled as a sling, folded as a normal bandage, or for specialized applications, such as on the head. One advantage of this type of bandage is that it can be makeshift and made from a fabric scrap or a piece of clothing. The Boy Scouts popularized the use of this bandage in many of their first aid lessons, as a part of the uniform is a \"neckerchief\" that can easily be folded to form a cravat. Tube bandage A tube bandage is applied using an applicator, and is woven in a continuous circle. It is used to hold dressings or splints on to limbs, or to provide support to sprains and strains, so that it stops bleeding. Kirigami bandage A new type of bandage was invented in 2016; inspired by the art of kirigami , it uses parallel slits to better fit areas of the body that bend. The bandages have been produced with 3D-printed molds.

        "content": "Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (the 5th and 4th centuries BC) in Ancient Greece , [ 1 ] marked by much of the eastern Aegean and northern regions of Greek culture (such as Ionia and Macedonia ) gaining increased autonomy from the Persian Empire ; the peak flourishing of democratic Athens ; the First and Second Peloponnesian Wars ; the Spartan and then Theban hegemonies ; and the expansion of Macedonia under Philip II . Much of the early defining mathematics, science, artistic thought ( architecture , sculpture), theatre , literature , philosophy , and politics of Western civilization derives from this period of Greek history , which had a powerful influence on the later Roman Empire . Part of the broader era of classical antiquity , the classical Greek era ended after Philip II 's unification of most of the Greek world against the common enemy of the Persian Empire, which was conquered within 13 years during the wars of Alexander the Great , Philip's son. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of ancient Greece , the Classical period corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Greek Dark Ages and Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period . 5th century BC Pelasgians Helladic chronology Cycladic ( c. 3100–1000 BC) Minoan ( c. 3100–1100 BC) Mycenean ( c. 1750–1050 BC) Greek Dark Ages (1100 BC–750 BC) Archaic Greece (800 BC–480 BC) Classical Greece (500 BC–323 BC) Hellenistic Greece (323 BC–31 BC) Roman Greece (146 BC–330 AD) Byzantine Greece Frankish and Latin states (1204-1579) Venetian Crete (1205-1667) Venetian Ionian Islands (1363-1797) Ottoman Greece (1371-1822) Septinsular Republic (1800-1807) War of Independence (1821-1829) First Hellenic Republic (1822-1832) Kingdom of Greece (1832-1924, 1935-1973) National Schism (1914/15-1917) Second Hellenic Republic (1924-1935) 4th of August Regime (1936-1941) Axis occupation ( Collaborationist regime , Free Greece ) (1941-1944) Civil War (1946-1949) Military Junta (1967-1974) Third Hellenic Republic (1974-) Agriculture Alphabet Art Church Constitution Economy Ethnonyms Language Music Military v t e This century is essentially studied from the Athenian outlook because Athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than any of the other ancient Greek states . From the perspective of Athenian culture in classical Greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century BC extends slightly into the 6th century BC. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 BC, with the fall of the last Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes ' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek world might place its beginning at the Ionian Revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians were defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt , in 481–479 BC, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day Greece (north of the Isthmus of Corinth ) at a crucial point during the war following the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Delian League then formed, under Athenian hegemony and as Athens' instrument. Athens' successes caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but Athenian dynamism finally awoke Sparta and brought about the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC. After both sides were exhausted, a brief peace followed; then the war resumed in Sparta's favor. Athens was decisively defeated in 404 BC, and internal unrest marked the end of the 5th century BC in Greece. Since its beginning, Sparta had been ruled by a diarchy . This meant that Sparta had two kings ruling concurrently throughout its entire history. The two kingships were both hereditary, vested in the Agiad dynasty and the Eurypontid dynasty. According to legend, the respective hereditary lines of these two dynasties sprang from Eurysthenes and Procles , twin descendants of Hercules . They were said to have conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War . Athens under Cleisthenes In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias , son of Peisistratos . Cleomenes I , king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras . But his rival Cleisthenes , with the support of the middle class and aided by pro-democracy citizens, took over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through Cleisthenes' reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)—and established ostracism . The isonomic and isegoric (equal freedom of speech) [ 4 ] democracy was first organized into about 130 demes , which became the basic civic element. The 10,000 citizens exercised their power as members of the assembly ( ἐκκλησία , ekklesia ), headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random. The city's administrative geography was reworked, in order to create mixed political groups: not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming, whose decisions (e.g. a declaration of war) would depend on their geographical position. The territory of the city was also divided into thirty trittyes as follows: ten trittyes in the coastal region ( παρᾰλία , paralia ) ten trittyes in the ἄστυ ( astu ), the urban centre ten trittyes in the rural interior, ( μεσογεία , mesogia ). A tribe consisted of three trittyes, selected at random, one from each of the three groups. Each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors. It was this corpus of reforms that allowed the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s BC. The Persian Wars In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey ), the Greek cities, which included great centres such as Miletus and Halicarnassus , were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid-6th century BC. In 499 BC that region's Greeks rose in the Ionian Revolt , and Athens and some other Greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 BC at the Battle of Lade . Asia Minor returned to Persian control. In 492 BC, the Persian general Mardonius led a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia . He was victorious and again subjugated the former and conquered the latter, [ 5 ] but he was wounded and forced to retreat back into Asia Minor. In addition, a fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied Mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of Mount Athos . Later, the generals Artaphernes and Datis led a successful naval expedition against the Aegean islands. In 490 BC, Darius the Great , having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a Persian fleet to punish the Greeks. (Historians are uncertain about their number of men; accounts vary from 18,000 to 100,000.) They landed in Attica intending to take Athens, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army of 9,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plataeans led by the Athenian general Miltiades . The Persian fleet continued to Athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault. In 480 BC, Darius' successor Xerxes I sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the Hellespont . This army took Thrace, before descending on Thessaly and Boeotia, whilst the Persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops. The Greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block Cape Artemision . After being delayed by Leonidas I , the Spartan king of the Agiad Dynasty, at the Battle of Thermopylae (a battle made famous by the 300 Spartans who faced the entire Persian army), Xerxes advanced into Attica, and captured and burned Athens . The subsequent Battle of Artemisium resulted in the capture of Euboea , bringing most of mainland Greece north of the Isthmus of Corinth under Persian control. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] However, the Athenians had evacuated the city of Athens by sea before Thermopylae, and under the command of Themistocles , they defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis , where the smaller Greek navy exploited the narrow straits to neutralize the Persians' numerical advantage and inflict a decisive blow. In 483 BC, during the period of peace between the two Persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the Laurion (a small mountain range near Athens), and the hundreds of talents mined there were used to build 200 warships to combat Aeginetan piracy. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias , defeated the Persian army at Plataea . The Persians then began to withdraw from Greece, and never attempted an invasion again. The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians from the Aegean Sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the Battle of Mycale ; then in 478 BC the fleet captured Byzantium . At that time Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the Delian League , so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos . The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power. The Peloponnesian War Origins of the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League In 431 BC war broke out between Athens and Sparta . The war was a struggle not merely between two city-states but rather between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states: [ 6 ] the Delian League , led by Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. The Delian League grew out of the need to present a unified front of all Greek city-states against Persian aggression. In 481 BC, Greek city-states, including Sparta, met in the first of a series of \"congresses\" that strove to unify all the Greek city-states against the danger of another Persian invasion. [ 7 ] The coalition that emerged from the first congress was named the \"Hellenic League\" and included Sparta. Persia, under Xerxes, invaded Greece in September 481 BC, but the Athenian navy defeated the Persian navy. The Persian land forces were delayed in 480 BC by a much smaller force of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans and 700 men from Boeotian Thespiae at the Battle of Thermopylae . [ 8 ] The Persians left Greece in 479 BC after their defeat at Plataea . [ 9 ] Plataea was the final battle of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. After this, the Persians never again tried to invade Greece. With the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the Hellenic League. [ 10 ] In 477, Athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include Sparta. This coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of Delos. [ 11 ] Thus, the League took the name \"Delian League\". Its formal purpose was to liberate Greek cities still under Persian control. [ 12 ] However, it became increasingly apparent that the Delian League was really a front for Athenian hegemony throughout the Aegean. [ 13 ] A competing coalition of Greek city-states centred around Sparta arose, and became more important as the external Persian threat subsided. This coalition is known as the Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, this league was not a response to any external threat, Persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at Sparta's security and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese peninsula. [ 14 ] The term \"Peloponnesian League\" is a misnomer. It was not really a \"league\" at all. Nor was it really \"Peloponnesian\". [ 14 ] There was no equality at all between the members, as might be implied by the term \"league\". Furthermore, most of its members were located outside the Peloponnese Peninsula. [ 14 ] The terms \"Spartan League\" and \"Peloponnesian League\" are modern terms. Contemporaries instead referred to \" Lacedaemonians and their Allies\" to describe the \"league\". [ 14 ] The league had its origins in Sparta's conflict with Argos , another city on the Peloponnese Peninsula. In the 7th century BC Argos dominated the peninsula. Even in the early 6th century the Argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the peninsula. The rise of Sparta in the 6th century brought Sparta into conflict with Argos. However, with the conquest of the Peloponnesian city-state of Tegea in 550 BC and the defeat of the Argives in 546 BC the Spartans' control began to reach well beyond the borders of Laconia . The thirty years peace As the two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict. Under the influence of King Archidamus II (the Eurypontid king of Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC [ 15 ] Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones. [ 16 ] Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that war was inevitable. [ 17 ] As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a \"diarchy\" with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. One line of hereditary kings was from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynasty. With the signing of the Thirty Years Peace treaty, Archidamus II felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours. [ 18 ] However, the strong war party in Sparta soon won out and in 431 BC Archidamus was forced to go to war with the Delian League. However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta. [ 19 ] Causes of the Peloponnesian war The immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely Thucydides and Plutarch . Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, Corcyra (modern-day Corfu ), went to war in 435 BC over the new Corcyran colony of Epidamnus . [ 20 ] Sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle. [ 21 ] In 433 BC, Corcyra sought Athenian assistance in the war. Corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of Athens. However, to further encourage Athens to enter the conflict, Corcyra pointed out how useful a friendly relationship with Corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of Corcyra itself and the colony of Epidamnus on the east shore of the Adriatic Sea. [ 22 ] Furthermore, Corcyra promised that Athens would have the use of Corcyra's navy, the third-largest in Greece. This was too good an offer for Athens to refuse. Accordingly, Athens signed a defensive alliance with Corcyra. The next year, in 432 BC, Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia ), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea. [ 23 ] In 434–433 BC Athens issued the \" Megarian Decrees \", a series of decrees that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people. [ 24 ] The Peloponnesian League accused Athens of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, Sparta formally declared war on Athens. Many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other. The Peloponnesian war: Opening stages (431–421 BC) Sparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica , but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of Pericles . At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnesus, winning battles at Naupactus (429) and Pylos (425). However, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421). The Peloponnesian war: Second phase (418–404 BC) In 418 BC, however, conflict between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of hostilities. Alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the Athenians to ally with Argos against the Spartans. [ 25 ] At the Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. Accordingly, Argos and the rest of the Peloponnesus was brought back under the control of Sparta. [ 25 ] The return of peace allowed Athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the Peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order. Soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into Athens. [ 25 ] A strong \"peace party\" arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the Athenian Empire . Concentration on the Athenian Empire, however, brought Athens into conflict with another Greek state. Ever since the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens. [ 26 ] In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality. [ 26 ] Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was inclined toward military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the south-west Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League. [ 26 ] This continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the Delian League. The debate between Athens and Melos over the issue of joining the Delian League is presented by Thucydides in his Melian Dialogue . [ 27 ] The debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between Melos and Athens and Melos was invaded in 416 BC, and soon occupied by Athens. This success on the part of Athens whetted the appetite of the people of Athens for further expansion of the Athenian Empire. [ 28 ] Accordingly, the people of Athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by Alcibiades . Thus, in 415 BC, Alcibiades found support within the Athenian Assembly for his position when he urged that Athens launch a major expedition against Syracuse , a Peloponnesian ally in Sicily , Magna Graecia . [ 29 ] Segesta, a town in Sicily, had requested Athenian assistance in their war with another Sicilian town—the town of Selinus. Although Nicias was a sceptic about the Sicilian Expedition , he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition. [ 30 ] However, unlike the expedition against Melos, the citizens of Athens were deeply divided over Alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far-off Sicily. In June 415 BC, on the very eve of the departure of the Athenian fleet for Sicily, a band of vandals in Athens defaced the many statues of the god Hermes that were scattered throughout the city of Athens. [ 31 ] This action was blamed on Alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign. [ 32 ] In all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of Hermes was the action of the peace party. [ 33 ] Having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken Alcibiades' hold on the people of Athens. Successfully blaming Alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened Alcibiades and the war party in Athens. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of Hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet. Such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated. Even before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes, prompting Alcibiades to flee to Sparta. [ 34 ] When the fleet later landed in Sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster. The entire expeditionary force was lost and Nicias was captured and executed. This was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of Athens. Meanwhile, Alcibiades betrayed Athens and became a chief advisor to the Spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land. Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time—large enough to challenge the Athenian superiority at sea. Additionally, Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes—the Persians. As noted below, Alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in Sparta when he was accused of having seduced Timaea, the wife of Agis II, the Eurypontid king of Sparta. [ 19 ] Accordingly, Alcibiades was required to flee from Sparta and seek the protection of the Persian Court. In the Persian court, Alcibiades now betrayed both Athens and Sparta. He encouraged Persia to give Sparta financial aid to build a navy, advising that long and continuous warfare between Sparta and Athens would weaken both city-states and allow the Persians to dominate the Greek peninsula. Among the war party in Athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to Sicily in 415–413 could have been avoided if Alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition. Thus, despite his treacherous flight to Sparta and his collaboration with Sparta and later with the Persian court, there arose a demand among the war party that Alcibiades be allowed to return to Athens without being arrested. Alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the Athenian-controlled island of Samos . Alcibiades felt that \"radical democracy\" was his worst enemy. Accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in Athens. If the coup were successful Alcibiades promised to return to Athens. In 411, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in Athens, by a group which became known as \"the 400\". However, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in Samos failed. Alcibiades was immediately made an admiral ( navarch ) in the Athenian navy. Later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 were replaced by a broader oligarchy called \"the 5000\". Alcibiades did not immediately return to Athens. In early 410, Alcibiades led an Athenian fleet of 18 triremes against the Persian-financed Spartan fleet at Abydos near the Hellespont . The Battle of Abydos had actually begun before the arrival of Alcibiades, and had been inclining slightly toward the Athenians. However, with the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenian victory over the Spartans became a rout. Only the approach of nightfall and the movement of Persian troops to the coast where the Spartans had beached their ships saved the Spartan navy from total destruction. Following Alcibiades' advice, the Persian Empire had been playing Sparta and Athens off against each other. However, as weak as the Spartan navy was after the Battle of Abydos, the Persian navy directly assisted the Spartans. Alcibiades then pursued and met the combined Spartan and Persian fleets at the Battle of Cyzicus later in the spring of 410, achieving a significant victory. With the financial help of the Persians, Sparta built a fleet to challenge Athenian naval supremacy. With the new fleet and new military leader Lysander , Sparta attacked Abydos , seizing the strategic initiative. By occupying the Hellespont , the source of Athens' grain imports, Sparta effectively threatened Athens with starvation. [ 35 ] In response, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, but were decisively defeated at Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. Lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the \" Thirty Tyrants \" to govern Athens. Meanwhile, in Sparta, Timaea gave birth to a child. The child was given the name Leotychidas, after the great grandfather of Agis II—King Leotychidas of Sparta. However, because of Timaea's alleged affair with Alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young Leotychidas was fathered by Alcibiades. [ 19 ] Indeed, Agis II refused to acknowledge Leotychidas as his son until he relented, in front of witnesses, on his deathbed in 400 BC. [ 36 ] Upon the death of Agis II, Leotychidas attempted to claim the Eurypontid throne for himself, but this was met with an outcry, led by Lysander, who was at the height of his influence in Sparta. [ 36 ] Lysander argued that Leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the Eurypontid throne; [ 36 ] instead he backed the hereditary claim of Agesilaus, son of Agis by another wife. With Lysander's support, Agesilaus became the Eurypontid king as Agesilaus II , expelled Leotychidas from the country, and took over all of Agis' estates and property. 4th century BC The end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece, but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role. [ 37 ] Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and in other cities. In 395 BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. Athens , Argos , Thebes , and Corinth, the latter two former Spartan allies, challenged Sparta's dominance in the Corinthian War , which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked the Greeks by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia. The agreement turned over the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus, reversing a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war in which Thebes allied with its old enemy Athens. Then the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis . In 346 BC the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time. [ 38 ] The Peloponnesian War was a radical turning point for the Greek world. Before 403 BC, the situation was more defined, with Athens and its allies (a zone of domination and stability, with a number of island cities benefiting from Athens' maritime protection), and other states outside this Athenian Empire. The sources denounce this Athenian supremacy (or hegemony ) as smothering and disadvantageous. [ note 1 ] After 403 BC, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived. The first of these turnarounds was managed by Athens as early as 390 BC, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory. Spartan hegemony This empire was powerful but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all—of Athens' allies and of Athens itself—and their power was undivided. By the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta. [ 39 ] The subject of how to reorganize the Athenian Empire as part of the Spartan Empire provoked much heated debate among Sparta's full citizens. The admiral Lysander felt that the Spartans should rebuild the Athenian empire in such a way that Sparta profited from it. Lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others. [ 40 ] Prior to this, Spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots (which generally discouraged their accumulation) and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property. Without the Spartans' support, Lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him—on Samos, for example, festivals known as Lysandreia were organized in his honour. He was recalled to Sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters. Sparta refused to see Lysander or his successors dominate. Not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 BC not to support the directives that he had made. Agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century BC. This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the Spartan state. Agesilaus employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-Hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the Persian empire. [ 41 ] Once again, the Persian empire played both sides against each other. The Persian Court supported Sparta in the rebuilding of their navy while simultaneously funding the Athenians, who used Persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls (destroyed in 404 BC) as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories. For most of the first years of his reign, Agesilaus had been engaged in a war against Persia in the Aegean Sea and in Asia Minor. [ 42 ] In 394 BC, the Spartan authorities ordered Agesilaus to return to mainland Greece. While Agesilaus had a large part of the Spartan Army in Asia Minor, the Spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces led by Corinth. [ 43 ] At the Battle of Haliartus the Spartans had been defeated by the Theban forces. Worse yet, Lysander, Sparta's chief military leader, had been killed during the battle. [ 44 ] This was the start of what became known as the \" Corinthian War \" (395–387 BC). [ 41 ] Upon hearing of the Spartan loss at Haliartus and of the death of Lysander, Agesilaus headed out of Asia Minor, back across the Hellespont, across Thrace and back towards Greece. At the Battle of Coronea , Agesilaus and his Spartan Army defeated a Theban force. During the war, Corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional Spartan enemies—Argos, Athens and Thebes. [ 45 ] However, when the war descended into guerilla tactics, Sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with Persia. [ 45 ] The long Corinthian War finally ended with the Peace of Antalcidas or the King's Peace , in which the \"Great King\" of Persia, Artaxerxes II , pronounced a \"treaty\" of peace between the various city-states of Greece which broke up all \"leagues\" of city-states on Greek mainland and in the islands of the Aegean Sea . Although this was looked upon as \"independence\" for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral \"treaty\" was highly favourable to the interests of the Persian Empire. The Corinthian War revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in Greece. While Athens and Sparta fought each other to exhaustion, Thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various Greek city-states. In 387 BC, an edict was promulgated by the Persian king, preserving the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Cyprus as well as the independence of the Greek Aegean cities, except for Lymnos, Imbros and Skyros, which were given over to Athens. [ 46 ] It dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones. This is an ultimatum that benefited Athens only to the extent that Athens held onto three islands. While the \"Great King\", Artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, Sparta was to act as Persia's agent in enforcing the Peace. [ 47 ] To the Persians this document is known as the \" King's Peace \". To the Greeks, this document is known as the Peace of Antalcidas , after the Spartan diplomat Antalcidas who was sent to Persia as negotiator. Sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between Athens and Persia. Accordingly, Antalcidas was directed to get whatever agreement he could from the \"Great King\". Accordingly, the \"Peace of Antalcidas\" is not a negotiated peace at all. Rather it is a surrender to the interests of Persia, drafted entirely for its benefit. [ 47 ] On the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences. In accordance with it, the Boeotian League , or Boeotian confederacy, was dissolved in 386 BC. [ 48 ] This confederacy was dominated by Thebes, a city hostile to the Spartan hegemony. Sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in Epirus and in the north of Greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of Thebes, the Cadmea, after an expedition in the Chalcidice and the capture of Olynthos. It was a Theban politician who suggested to the Spartan general Phoibidas that Sparta should seize Thebes itself. This act was sharply condemned, though Sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by Phoibidas. The Spartan attack was successful and Thebes was placed under Spartan control. [ 49 ] In 378 BC, the reaction to Spartan control over Thebes was broken by a popular uprising within Thebes. Elsewhere in Greece, the reaction against Spartan hegemony began when Sphodrias, another Spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on Piraeus . [ 50 ] Although the gates of Piraeus were no longer fortified, Sphodrias was driven off before Piraeus. Back in Sparta, Sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the Spartan court. Nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between Athens and Thebes. [ 50 ] Sparta would now have to fight them both together. Athens was trying to recover from its defeat in the Peloponnesian War at the hands of Sparta's \"navarch\" Lysander in the disaster of 404 BC. The rising spirit of rebellion against Sparta also fueled Thebes' attempt to restore the former Boeotian confederacy. [ 51 ] In Boeotia , the Theban leaders Pelopidas and Epaminondas reorganized the Theban army and began to free the towns of Boeotia from their Spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived Boeotian League. [ 47 ] Pelopidas won a great victory for Thebes over a much larger Spartan force in the Battle of Tegyra in 375 BC. [ 52 ] Theban authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that Athens came to mistrust the growing Theban power. Athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second Athenian League. [ 53 ] Attention was drawn to growing power of Thebes when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, Phocis , and, particularly, after Thebes razed the city of Plataea , a long-standing ally of Athens, in 375 BC. [ 54 ] The destruction of Plataea caused Athens to negotiate an alliance with Sparta against Thebes, in that same year. [ 54 ] In 371, the Theban army, led by Epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on Spartan forces at Battle of Leuctra . Sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. The Battle of Leuctra was a watershed in Greek history. [ 54 ] Epaminondas' victory ended a long history of Spartan military prestige and dominance over Greece and the period of Spartan hegemony was over. However, Spartan hegemony was not replaced by Theban, but rather by Athenian hegemony. The rise of Athens It was important to erase the bad memories of the former league. Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens—unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league—but to the Athenian generals themselves. The Athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the eisphora . They reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the Proseiphora , in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors. This system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy . This league responded to a real and present need. On the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century BC, with Athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league. Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained. The main reasons for the eventual failure were structural. This alliance was only valued out of fear of Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'. The Athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360 BC, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364 BC) decided to secede. In 357 BC the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 BC and 355 BC, Athens had to face war against its allies—a war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of Persia in the form of an ultimatum to Athens, demanding that Athens recognise its allies' independence under threat of Persia's sending 200 triremes against Athens. Athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy, thereby weakening itself more and more, and signaling the end of Athenian hegemony. Theban hegemony – tentative and with no future This was not Thebes' first attempt at hegemony. It had been the most important city of Boeotia and the centre of the previous Boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386. The 5th-century confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus and known as \"the Anonyme of Thebes\". Thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy. Citizenship was defined according to wealth, and Thebes counted 11,000 active citizens. The confederacy was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a \" boeotarch \", a certain number of council members, 1,000 hoplites and 100 horsemen. From the 5th century BC the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders. It also had a small fleet that played a part in the Peloponnesian War by providing 25 triremes for the Spartans. At the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a \"navarch\". All this constituted a significant enough force that the Spartans were happy to see the Boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace. This dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the Thebans (who had lost the Cadmea to Sparta in 382 BC) from reforming this confederacy. Pelopidas and Epaminondas endowed Thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of Athens, the Thebans revived the title of \"Boeotarch\" lost in the Persian King's Peace and—with victory at Leuctra and the destruction of Spartan power—the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy. Epaminondas rid the Peloponnesus of pro-Spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-Theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by Sparta. He equally supported the reconstruction of the city of Messene thanks to an invasion of Laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them Messene as a capital. He decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the Peloponnessus, forming an Arcadian confederacy (the King's Peace had destroyed a previous Arcadian confederacy and put Messene under Spartan control). The strength of the Boeotian League explains Athens' problems with her allies in the second Athenian League. Epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the Athenian league and joining a Boeotian maritime league. Epaminondas and Pelopidas also reformed the army of Thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting. Thus, the Theban army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other Greek states at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC. Sparta also remained an important power in the face of Theban strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In 367 BC, both Sparta and Athens sent delegates to Artaxerxes II, the Great King of Persia. These delegates sought to have the Artaxerxes, once again, declare Greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 BC. As noted above, this had meant the destruction of the Boeotian League in 387 BC. Sparta and Athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar \"Kings Peace\". Thebes sent Pelopidas to argue against them. [ 55 ] The Great King was convinced by Pelopidas and the Theban diplomats that Thebes and the Boeotian League would be the best agents of Persian interests in Greece, and, accordingly, did not issue a new \"King's Peace\". [ 48 ] Thus, to deal with Thebes, Athens and Sparta were thrown back on their own resources. Thebes, meanwhile, expanded its influence beyond the bounds of Boeotia. In 364 BC, Pelopidas defeated the Alexander of Pherae in the Battle of Cynoscephalae , located in south-eastern Thessaly in northern Greece. However, during the battle, Pelopides was killed. [ 56 ] The confederational framework of Sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea , which re-allied in the Arcadian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians, and the Tegeans that of the Thebans. In 362 BC, Epaminondas led a Theban army against a coalition of Athenian, Spartan, Elisian, Mantinean and Achean forces. Battle was joined at Mantinea. [ 48 ] The Thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for Epaminondas died in the battle, stating that \"I bequeath to Thebes two daughters, the victory of Leuctra and the victory at Mantinea\". Despite the victory at Mantinea , in the end, the Thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the Peloponnesus. This event is looked upon as a watershed in Greek history. Thus, Xenophon concludes his history of the Greek world at this point, in 362 BC. The end of this period was even more confused than its beginning. Greece had failed and, according to Xenophon, the history of the Greek world was no longer intelligible. The idea of hegemony disappeared. From 362 BC onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in Greece. The Spartans were greatly weakened; the Athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; Thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat Sparta and Athens but not to be a major power in Asia Minor. Other forces also intervened, such as the Persian king, who appointed himself arbitrator among the Greek cities, with their tacit agreement. This situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for them. One war led to another, each longer and more bloody than the last, and the cycle could not be broken. Hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the invasion of Laconia in 370 BC. Rise of Macedon Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC. The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Philip of Macedon was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas . Within a short time, Philip was acclaimed king as Philip II of Macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs. [ 57 ] During his lifetime, Philip II consolidated his rule over Macedonia. This was done by 359 BC and Philip began to look toward expanding Macedonia's influence abroad. Under Philip II , (359–336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians , Thracians , and Illyrians . [ 58 ] In 358 BC, Philip allied with Epirus in its campaign against Illyria. In 357 BC, Philip came into direct conflict with Athens when he conquered the Thracian port city of Amphipolis , a city located at the mouth of the Strymon River to the east of Macedonia, and a major Athenian trading port. Conquering this city allowed Philip to subjugate all of Thrace. A year later in 356 BC, the Macedonians attacked and conquered the Athenian-controlled port city of Pydna . This brought the Macedonian threat to Athens closer to home to the Athenians. With the start of the Phocian War in 356 BC, the great Athenian orator and political leader of the \"war party\", Demosthenes , became increasingly active in encouraging Athens to fight vigorously against Philip's expansionist aims. [ 59 ] In 352 BC, Demosthenes gave many speeches against the Macedonian threat, declaring Philip II Athens' greatest enemy. The leader of the Athenian \"peace party\" was Phocion , who wished to avoid a confrontation that, Phocion felt, would be catastrophic for Athens. Despite Phocion's attempts to restrain the war party, Athens remained at war with Macedonia for years following the original declaration of war. [ 60 ] Negotiations between Athens and Philip II started only in 346 BC. [ 61 ] The Athenians successfully halted Philip's invasion of Attica at Thermopylae that same year in 352 BC. However, Philip defeated the Phocians at the Battle of the Crocus Field . The conflict between Macedonia and a coalition of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes came to a head in 338 BC, [ 62 ] at the Battle of Chaeronea . The Macedonians became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Greece, but also retained more archaic aspects harking back to the palace culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella , resembling Mycenaean culture more than that of the Classical city-states. Militarily, Philip recognized the new phalanx style of fighting that had been employed by Epaminondas and Pelopidas in Thebes. Accordingly, he incorporated this new system into the Macedonian army. Philip II also brought a Theban military tutor to Macedon to instruct the future Alexander the Great in the Theban method of fighting. [ 63 ] Philip's son Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) was born in Pella , Macedonia. Philip II brought Aristotle to Pella to teach the young Alexander. [ 64 ] Besides Alexander's mother, Olympias, Philip took another wife by the name of Cleopatra Eurydice . [ 65 ] Cleopatra had a daughter, Europa, and a son, Caranus . Caranus posed a threat to the succession of Alexander. [ 66 ] Cleopatra Eurydice was a Macedonian and, thus, Caranus was all Macedonian in blood. Olympias, on the other hand, was from Epirus and, thus, Alexander was regarded as being only half-Macedonian (Cleopatra Eurydice should not be confused with Cleopatra of Macedon , who was Alexander's full-sister and thus daughter of Philip and Olympias). Philip II was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra of Macedon with King Alexander I of Epirus in 336 BC. [ 67 ] Philip's son, the future Alexander the Great , immediately claimed the throne of Macedonia by eliminating all the other claimants to the throne, including Caranus and his cousin Amytas. [ 68 ] Alexander was only twenty years of age when he assumed the throne. [ 69 ] Thereafter, Alexander continued his father's plans to conquer all of Greece. He did this by both military might and persuasion. After his victory over Thebes, Alexander traveled to Athens to meet the public directly. Despite Demosthenes ' speeches against the Macedonian threat on behalf of the war party of Athens, the public in Athens was still very much divided between the \"peace party\" and Demosthenes' \"war party\". However, the arrival of Alexander charmed the Athenian public. [ 70 ] The peace party was strengthened and then a peace between Athens and Macedonia was agreed. [ 71 ] This allowed Alexander to move on his and the Greeks' long-held dream of conquest in the east, with a unified and secure Greek state at his back. In 334 BC, Alexander with about 30,000 infantry soldiers and 5,000 cavalry crossed the Hellespont into Asia. He never returned. [ 72 ] Alexander managed to briefly extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states, but also to the Persian empire , including Egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of India . [ 58 ] He managed to spread Greek culture throughout the known world. [ 73 ] Alexander the Great died in 323 BC in Babylon during his Asian campaign of conquest. [ 74 ] The Classical period conventionally ends at the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the fragmentation of his empire, divided among the Diadochi , [ 75 ] which, in the minds of most scholars, marks the beginning of the Hellenistic period . Legacy of classical Greece The legacy of Greece was strongly felt by post-Renaissance European elite, who saw themselves as the spiritual heirs of Greece. Will Durant wrote in 1939 that \"excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that does not come from Greece,\" and conversely \"there is nothing in Greek civilization that doesn't illuminate our own\".

        "title": "Parable of the Good Samaritan - Wikipedia",
        "content": "The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke . [ 1 ] It is about a traveler (implicitly understood to be Jewish) who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. A Jewish priest and then a Levite come by, both avoiding the man. A Samaritan happens upon him and—though Samaritans and Jews were generally antagonistic toward each other—helps him. Jesus tells the parable in response to a provocative question from a lawyer in the context of the Great Commandment : \"And who is my neighbour?\" [ 1 ] The conclusion is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to their fellow man or woman. Some Christians, such as Augustine , have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul. [ 2 ] Others discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable's original meaning [ 2 ] and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus. [ 3 ] The parable has inspired painting, sculpture, satire, poetry, photography, film, and many others. The phrase \" Good Samaritan \", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many hospitals and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan. Narrative In Luke 10 , the parable is introduced by a question, known as the Great Commandment : Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" He said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\" He answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\" He said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\" But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\" — Luke 10:25–29, World English Bible [ 4 ] Jesus replies with a story: Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan , as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii , gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\" He said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\" Then Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\" — Luke 10:30–37, World English Bible [ 5 ] Historical context Road from Jerusalem to Jericho In the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers who robbed people\". [ 6 ] Martin Luther King Jr. , on the day before his assassination , described the road as follows: I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles—or rather 1,200 feet (370 m) above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2,200 feet (670 m) below sea level. That's a dangerous road. — Martin Luther King Jr., \" I've Been to the Mountaintop \" (April 3, 1968) Samaritans and Jesus While relations between Jews and Samaritans as closely related ethnoreligious groups in the region are historically complex and not purely negative, a distinct downturn occurred in the late 2nd century BCE during the Hasmonean dynasty , which involved the destruction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim in 128 BCE. [ 7 ] In the early 1st century CE, Samaritans had desecrated the Jewish Temple at Passover with human bones. [ 8 ] Due to this hatred, some think that the lawyer's phrase \"The one who had mercy on him\" (Luke 10:37) [ 9 ] may indicate a reluctance to name the Samaritan. [ 10 ] Or, on another, more positive note, it may indicate that the lawyer has recognized that both his questions have been answered and now concludes by generally expressing that anyone behaving thus is a (Leviticus 19:18) [ 11 ] \"neighbor\" eligible to inherit eternal life. [ a ] As the story reached those who were unaware of its context—i.e., the oppression of the Samaritans, and the bitter hatred that Jesus' listeners and Samaritans had for each other—this aspect of the parable received less and less recognition; uninformed people saw \"Samaritan\" as merely a convenient name for that individual, when in fact it stood for \"hated outsider who worships falsely and desecrates our religion\" [ dubious – discuss ] . Today, to remedy this missing context, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] For example, anti-slavery campaigner William Jay described clergy who ignored slavery as \"following the example of the priest and Levite\". [ 14 ] Martin Luther King Jr. , in his April 1968 \" I've Been to the Mountaintop \" speech, described the Samaritan as \"a man of another race\". [ 15 ] Sundee Tucker Frazier saw the Samaritan more specifically as an example of a \" mixed-race \" person. [ 16 ] Klyne Snodgrass wrote: \"On the basis of this parable we must deal with our own racism but must also seek justice for, and offer assistance to, those in need, regardless of the group to which they belong.\" [ 17 ] Samaritans appear elsewhere in the Gospels and the Book of Acts. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus heals ten lepers and only the Samaritan among them thanks him, [ 18 ] [ 8 ] although Luke 9:51–56 [ 19 ] depicts Jesus receiving a hostile reception in Samaria. [ 20 ] Luke's favorable treatment of Samaritans is in line with the favorable treatment elsewhere in the book of the weak and of outcasts, generally. [ 21 ] In John , Jesus has an extended dialogue with a Samaritan woman , and many Samaritans come to believe in him. [ 22 ] In Matthew , he instructs his disciples not to preach to Gentiles or in Samaritan cities. [ 23 ] [ 8 ] In the Gospels, generally, \"though the Jews of Jesus' day had no time for the 'half-breed' people of Samaria\", [ 24 ] Jesus \"never spoke disparagingly about them\" [ 24 ] and \"held a benign view of Samaritans\". [ 25 ] Many see 2 Chronicles 28 :8–15 [ 26 ] as the model for the Samaritan's neighborly behavior in the parable. In Chronicles, Northern Israelite ancestors of Samaritans treat Judean enemies as fellow-Israelite neighbors. [ b ] After comparing the earlier account with the later parable presented to the expert in Israel's religious law, one could conclude: \"Given the number and significance of these parallels and points of correspondence it is hard to imagine how a first-century scholar of Scripture could hear the parable and not think of the story of the merciful Samaritans of 2 Chronicles 28.\" [ 27 ] Priests and Levites In Jewish culture, contact with a dead body was understood to be defiling. [ 8 ] Priests were particularly enjoined to avoid uncleanness. [ 8 ] The priest and Levite may therefore have assumed that the fallen traveler was dead and avoided him to keep themselves ritually clean. [ 8 ] On the other hand, the depiction of travel downhill (from Jerusalem to Jericho) may indicate that their temple duties had already been completed, making this explanation less likely, [ 28 ] although this is disputed. [ 20 ] Since the Mishnah made an exception for neglected corpses, [ 20 ] the priest and the Levite could have used the law to justify both touching a corpse or ignoring it. [ 20 ] In any case, passing by on the other side avoided checking \"whether he was dead or alive\". [ 29 ] Indeed, \"it weighed more with them that he might be dead and defiling to the touch of those whose business was with holy things than that he might be alive and in need of care.\" [ 29 ] Interpretation Allegorical reading Origen described the allegory as follows: The man who was going down is Adam. Jerusalem is paradise, and Jericho is the world. The robbers are hostile powers. The priest is the Law , the Levite is the prophets , and the Samaritan is Christ. The wounds are disobedience, the beast is the Lord's body, the [inn], which accepts all who wish to enter, is the Church . [...] The manager of the [inn] is the head of the Church, to whom its care has been entrusted. And the fact that the Samaritan promises he will return represents the Savior's second coming . — Origen 1996 , p. 136, Homily 34, para 3 John Welch further states: This allegorical reading was taught not only by ancient followers of Jesus, but it was virtually universal throughout early Christianity, being advocated by Irenaeus , Clement , and Origen , and in the fourth and fifth centuries by Chrysostom in Constantinople, Ambrose in Milan, and Augustine in North Africa. This interpretation is found most completely in two other medieval stained-glass windows, in the French cathedrals at Bourges and Sens .\" — Welch 2007 , pp. 26–33 The allegorical interpretation is also traditional in the Eastern Orthodox Church . [ 30 ] John Newton refers to the allegorical interpretation in his hymn \"How Kind the Good Samaritan\", which begins: How kind the good Samaritan To him who fell among the thieves! Thus Jesus pities fallen man, And heals the wounds the soul receives. [ 31 ] Robert Funk also suggests that Jesus' Jewish listeners were to identify with the robbed and wounded man. In his view, the help received from a hated Samaritan is like the kingdom of God received as grace from an unexpected source. [ 32 ] Ethical reading John Calvin was not impressed by Origen 's allegorical reading: The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice (John 5:25). [ 33 ] As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ. — Calvin 1845 , p. 54 The meaning of the parable for Calvin was, instead, that \"compassion, which an enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man. Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.\" [ 34 ] In other writings, Calvin pointed out that people are not born merely for themselves, but rather \"mankind is knit together with a holy knot [...] we must not live for ourselves, but for our neighbors.\" [ 35 ] Earlier, Cyril of Alexandria had written that \"a crown of love is being twined for him who loves his neighbour.\" [ 36 ] Francis Schaeffer suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen. That is ugly. We are to have the example of the good Samaritan consciously in mind at all times.\" [ 37 ] Other modern theologians have taken similar positions. For example, G. B. Caird wrote: Dodd quotes as a cautionary example Augustine 's allegorisation of the Good Samaritan, in which the man is Adam, Jerusalem the heavenly city, Jericho the moon – the symbol of immortality; the thieves are the devil and his angels, who strip the man of immortality by persuading him to sin and so leave him (spiritually) half dead; the priest and Levite represent the Old Testament, the Samaritan Christ, the beast his flesh which he assumed at the Incarnation; the inn is the church and the innkeeper the apostle Paul. Most modern readers would agree with Dodd that this farrago bears no relationship to the real meaning of the parable. — Caird 1980 , p. 165 Joel B. Green writes that Jesus' final question (which, in something of a \"twist\", [ 38 ] reverses the question originally asked): [The question] presupposes the identification of \"anyone\" as a neighbor, then presses the point that such an identification opens wide the door of loving action. By leaving aside the identity of the wounded man and by portraying the Samaritan traveler as one who performs the law (and so as one whose actions are consistent with an orientation to eternal life), Jesus has nullified the worldview that gives rise to such questions as, Who is my neighbor? The purity-holiness matrix has been capsized. And, not surprisingly in the Third Gospel, neighborly love has been concretized in care for one who is, in this parable, self-evidently a social outcast — Green 1997 , p. 432 Such a reading of the parable makes it important in liberation theology , [ 39 ] where it provides a concrete anchoring for love [ 40 ] and indicates an \"all embracing reach of solidarity.\" [ 41 ] In Indian Dalit theology , it is seen as providing a \"life-giving message to the marginalized Dalits and a challenging message to the non-Dalits.\" [ 42 ] Martin Luther King Jr. often spoke of this parable, contrasting the rapacious philosophy of the robbers, and the self-preserving non-involvement of the priest and Levite, with the Samaritan's coming to the aid of the man in need. [ 43 ] King also extended the call for neighborly assistance to society at large: On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. — Martin Luther King Jr. , \"A Time to Break the Silence\", quoted in Hicks & Valeri 2008 , p. 31 Catholic view Thomas Aquinas states that there are three points to be noted in this parable: Firstly, the manifold misery of sinners: \"A certain man went down from Jerusalem.\" Secondly, is shown the manifold pity of Christ to the sinner: \"A certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him he had compassion on him.\" Thirdly, the rule which is given for imitation: \"Go, and do thou likewise.\" [ 44 ] Justus Knecht gives the deeper interpretation of this parable, according to the Church Fathers, writing: Jesus Himself is the Good Samaritan, as proved by His treatment of the robbed and wounded human race. Sin and the devil are the robbers who have despoiled man of his robe of innocence and all supernatural gifts, and grievously wounded him in his natural gifts. Thus man lay, weak, helpless, and half-dead. He still, it is true, possessed his natural life, but he had lost the supernatural life of grace, as well as the prospect of eternal life, and was powerless to raise himself from the misery of sin by any effort of his own. Neither priest nor Levite, i. e. neither sacrifice nor law of the Old Covenant, could help him, or heal his wounds; they only made him realize more fully his helpless condition. Then the Son of God, moved by compassion, came down from heaven to help poor fallen man, living at enmity with God. He healed his wounds with the wine of His Most Precious Blood and the oil of His grace, and took him to the inn, His Church. When He left this earth to return to heaven, He gave to the guardians of His Church the twofold treasure of His doctrine and His grace, and ordered them to tend the still weak man, until He Himself came back to reward every one according to his works. [ 45 ] Other interpretations In addition to these classical interpretations many scholars have drawn additional themes from the story. Some have suggested that religious tolerance was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Others have suggested that Jesus was attempting to convey an anti-establishment message, not necessarily in the sense of rejecting authority figures in general, but in the sense of rejecting religious hypocrisy. By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or the importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] The story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25–37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor\", possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews—i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite\", no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of love. The term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers. [ c ] In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn Ḥayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; Ḥayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are Ḳedushah\", i. 5; and Moses Ḥagis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit\", p. 258. Authenticity The Jesus Seminar voted this parable to be authentic, [ 51 ] [ 52 ] with 60% of fellows rating it \"red\" (authentic) and a further 29% rating it \"pink\" (probably authentic). [ 52 ] The paradox of a disliked outsider such as a Samaritan helping a Jew is typical of Jesus' provocative parables, [ 51 ] [ 20 ] and is a deliberate feature of this parable. [ 53 ] In the Greek text, the shock value of the Samaritan's appearance is enhanced by the emphatic Σαμαρίτης , Samaritēs at the beginning of the sentence in verse 33. [ 20 ] Bernard Brandon Scott, a member of the Jesus Seminar, questions the authenticity of the parable's context, suggesting that \"the parable originally circulated separately from the question about neighborliness\" [ 54 ] and that the \"existence of the lawyer's question in Mark 12:28–34 [ 55 ] and Matthew 22:34–40, [ 56 ] in addition to the evidence of heavy Lukan editing\" [ 54 ] indicates the parable and its context were \"very probably joined editorially by Luke.\" [ 54 ] A number of other commentators share this opinion, [ 57 ] with the consensus of the Jesus Seminar being that verses Luke 10:36–37 [ 58 ] were added by Luke to \"connect with the lawyer's question.\" [ 52 ] On the other hand, the \"keen rabbinic interest in the question of the greatest commandment \" [ 57 ] may make this argument invalid, in that Luke may be describing a different occurrence of the question being asked. [ 57 ] Differences between the gospels suggest that Luke is referring to a different episode from Mark and Matthew, [ 59 ] and Klyne Snodgrass writes that \"While one cannot exclude that Luke has joined two originally separate narratives, evidence for this is not convincing.\" [ 59 ] The Oxford Bible Commentary notes: That Jesus was only tested once in this way is not a necessary assumption. The twist between the lawyer's question and Jesus' answer is entirely in keeping with Jesus' radical stance: he was making the lawyer rethink his presuppositions. — Barton & Muddiman 2001 , p. 942 The unexpected appearance of the Samaritan led Joseph Halévy to suggest that the parable originally involved \"a priest, a Levite, and an Israelite\", [ 53 ] in line with contemporary Jewish stories, and that Luke changed the parable to be more familiar to a gentile audience.\" [ 53 ] Halévy further suggests that, in real life, it was unlikely that a Samaritan would actually have been found on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, [ 53 ] although others claim that there was \"nothing strange about a Samaritan travelling in Jewish territory\". [ 10 ] William C. Placher points out that such debate misinterprets the biblical genre of a parable, which illustrates a moral rather than a historical point: on reading the story, \"we are not inclined to check the story against the police blotter for the Jerusalem-Jericho highway patrol. We recognize that Jesus is telling a story to illustrate a moral point, and that such stories often don't claim to correspond to actual events.\" [ 60 ] The traditionally understood ethical moral of the story would not hold if the parable originally followed the priest-Levite-Israelite sequence of contemporary Jewish stories, as Halévy suggested, for then it would deal strictly with intra-Israelite relations just as did the Lev 19:18 command under discussion. As a metaphor and name The term \"good Samaritan\" is used as a common metaphor: \"The word now applies to any charitable person, especially one who, like the man in the parable, rescues or helps out a needy stranger.\" [ 61 ] The name has consequently been used for a number of charitable organizations, including Samaritans , Samaritan's Purse , Sisters of the Good Samaritan , and The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong . The name Good Samaritan Hospital is used for a number of hospitals around the world. Good Samaritan laws protect those who choose to serve and tend to others who are injured or ill. [ 62 ] Art and popular culture The parable of the Good Samaritan was one of the most popular in medieval art. [ 63 ] The allegorical interpretation was often illustrated, with Christ as the Good Samaritan. Accompanying angels were sometimes also shown. [ 64 ] In some Eastern Orthodox icons of the parable, the identification of the Good Samaritan as Christ is made explicit with a halo bearing a cross. [ 65 ] The numerous later artistic depictions of the parable include those of Rembrandt , Jan Wijnants , Vincent van Gogh , Aimé Morot , Domenico Fetti , Johann Carl Loth , George Frederic Watts , and Giacomo Conti . Vincent van Gogh's painting captures the reverse hierarchy that is underscored in Luke's parable. Although the priest and Levite are near the top of the status hierarchy in Israel and the Samaritans near the bottom, van Gogh reverses this hierarchy in the painting. In his essay Lost in Non-Translation , biochemist and author Isaac Asimov argues that to the Jews of the time there were no good Samaritans; in his view, this was half the point of the parable. As Asimov put it, we need to think of the story occurring in Alabama in 1950, with a mayor and a preacher ignoring a man who has been beaten and robbed, with the role of the Samaritan being played by a poor black sharecropper. The story's theme is portrayed throughout Marvel's Daredevil . [ 66 ] The parable of the Good Samaritan is the theme for the Austrian Christian Charity commemorative coin , minted 12 March 2003. This coin shows the Good Samaritan with the wounded man, on his horse, as he takes him to an inn for medical attention. An older coin with this theme is the American \"Good Samaritan Shilling\" of 1652. [ 67 ] Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a poem on the parable (\"The Good Samaritan\"), of which the third stanza reads: He's been a fool, perhaps, and would Have prospered had he tried, But he was one who never could Pass by the other side. An honest man whom men called soft, While laughing in their sleeves— No doubt in business ways he oft Had fallen amongst thieves. — The Good Samaritan, Lawson 1906 , p. 132 John Gardiner Calkins Brainard also wrote a poem on the theme. [ 68 ] Dramatic film adaptations of the Parable of the Good Samaritan include the short film Samaritan (2006), set in a modern context, per the literary device of the Modern Parables DVD Bible study series. [ 69 ] The English composer, Benjamin Britten , was commissioned to write a piece to mark the centenary of the Red Cross . His resulting work for solo voices, choir, and orchestra, Cantata Misericordium , sets a Latin text by Patrick Wilkinson that tells the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was first performed in Geneva in 1963. In a real-life psychology experiment sometime before 1973, a number of seminary students – in a rush to teach on this parable – failed to stop to help a shabbily dressed person on the side of the road. [ 70 ] The Good Samaritan by Rembrandt (1630) shows the Good Samaritan making arrangements with the innkeeper. A later (1633) print by Rembrandt has a reversed and somewhat expanded version of the scene. [ 71 ] The good Samaritan, after Delacroix by Van Gogh , 1890 Christian Charity coin Legal presence In the English law of negligence , when establishing a duty of care in Donoghue v Stevenson Lord Atkin applied the neighbour principle —drawing inspiration from the Biblical Golden Rule [ 72 ] as in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

        "content": "Roman Empire Western Roman Empire Eastern Roman Empire Western Roman Empire Eastern Roman Empire The Roman army ( Latin : exercitus Romanus ) served ancient Rome and the Roman people , enduring through the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 476/1453), including the Western Roman Empire (collapsed AD 476/480 ) and the Eastern Roman Empire (collapsed AD 1453 ). It is thus a term that broadly spans approximately 2,206 years, during which the force underwent numerous permutations in size , composition , organization , equipment and tactics , while conserving a core of lasting traditions. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Early Roman army (c. 550 – c. 300 BC) Until c. 550 BC , there was no \"national\" Roman army, but a series of clan-based war-bands which only coalesced into a united force in periods of serious external threat. Around 550 BC, during the period conventionally known as the rule of king Servius Tullius , it appears that a universal levy of eligible adult male citizens was instituted. This development apparently coincided with the introduction of heavy armour for most of the infantry. Although originally low in numbers, the Roman infantry was extremely effective and developed some influential battle strategies. The early Roman army was based on a compulsory levy from adult male citizens which was held at the start of each campaigning season, in those years that war was declared. There were no standing or professional forces. During the regal period (to c. 500 BC), the standard levy was probably of 9,000 men, consisting of 6,000 heavily armed infantry (probably Greek-style hoplites ), plus 2,400 light-armed infantry ( rorarii , later called velites ) and 600 light cavalry ( equites celeres ). When the kings were replaced by two annually elected praetores in c. 500 BC, the standard levy remained of the same size, but was now divided equally between the praetors, each commanding one legion of 4,500 men. It is likely that the hoplite element was deployed in a Greek-style phalanx formation in large set-piece battles . However, these were relatively rare, with most fighting consisting of small-scale border-raids and skirmishing. In these, the Romans would fight in their basic tactical unit, the centuria of 100 men. In addition, separate clan-based forces remained in existence until c. 450 BC at least, although they would operate under the Praetors' authority, at least nominally. In 493 BC, shortly after the establishment of the Roman Republic , Rome concluded a perpetual treaty of military alliance (the Foedus Cassianum ), with the combined other Latin city-states. The treaty, probably motivated by the need for the Latins to deploy a united defence against incursions by neighbouring hill-tribes, provided for each party to provide an equal force for campaigns under unified command. It remained in force until 358 BC. Roman army of the mid-Republic (c. 300 – 107 BC) The central feature of the Roman army of the mid-Republic , or the Polybian army, was the manipular organization of its battle-line. Instead of a single, large mass (the phalanx ) as in the Early Roman army , the Romans now drew up in three lines consisting of small units (maniples) of 120 men, arrayed in chessboard fashion, giving much greater tactical strength and flexibility. This structure was probably introduced in c. 300 BC during the Samnite Wars . Also probably dating from this period was the regular accompaniment of each legion by a non-citizen formation of roughly equal size, the ala , recruited from Rome's Italian allies, or socii . The latter were approximately 150 autonomous states which were bound by a treaty of perpetual military alliance with Rome. Their sole obligation was to supply to the Roman army, on demand, a number of fully equipped troops up to a specified maximum each year. The Second Punic War (218–201 BC) saw the addition of a third element to the existing dual Roman/Italian structure: non-Italian mercenaries with specialist skills lacking in the legions and alae : Numidian light cavalry , Cretan archers , and Balearic slingers . From this time, these units always accompanied Roman armies. The Republican army of this period, like its earlier forebear, did not maintain standing or professional military forces, but levied them, by compulsory conscription, as required for each campaigning season and disbanded thereafter (although formations could be kept in being over winter during major wars). The standard levy was doubled during the Samnite Wars to four legions (two per consul), for a total of c. 18,000 Roman troops and four allied alae of similar size. Service in the legions was limited to property-owning Roman citizens, normally those known as iuniores (age 16–46). The army's senior officers, including its commanders-in-chief, the Roman consuls, were all elected annually at the People's Assembly. Only equites (members of the Roman knightly order) were eligible to serve as senior officers. Iuniores of the highest social classes ( equites and the First Class of commoners) provided the legion's cavalry, the other classes the legionary infantry. The proletarii (those assessed at under 400 drachmae wealth) were ineligible for legionary service and were assigned to the fleets as oarsmen. Elders, vagrants, freedmen, slaves and convicts were excluded from the military levy, save in emergencies. The legionary cavalry also changed, probably around 300 BC onwards from the light, unarmoured horse of the early army to a heavy force with metal armour (bronze cuirasses and, later, chain-mail shirts). Contrary to a long-held view, the cavalry of the mid-Republic was a highly effective force that generally prevailed against strong enemy cavalry forces (both Gallic and Greek) until it was decisively beaten by the Carthaginian general Hannibal 's horsemen during the Second Punic War. This was due to Hannibal's greater operational flexibility owing to his Numidian light cavalry. The Polybian army's operations during its existence can be divided into three broad phases. (1) The struggle for hegemony over Italy, especially against the Samnite League (338–264 BC); (2) the struggle with Carthage for hegemony in the western Mediterranean Sea (264–201 BC); and (3) the struggle against the Hellenistic monarchies for control of the eastern Mediterranean (201–91 BC). During the earlier phase, the normal size of the levy (including allies) was in the region of 40,000 men (two consular armies of c. 20,000 men each). During the latter phase, with lengthy wars of conquest followed by permanent military occupation of overseas provinces, the character of the army necessarily changed from a temporary force based entirely on short-term conscription to a standing army in which the conscripts, whose service was in this period limited by law to six consecutive years, were complemented by large numbers of volunteers who were willing to serve for much longer periods. Many of the volunteers were drawn from the poorest social class, which until the Second Punic War had been excluded from service in the legions by the minimum property requirement: during that war, extreme manpower needs had forced the army to ignore the requirement, and this practice continued thereafter. Maniples were gradually phased out as the main tactical unit, and replaced by the larger cohorts used in the allied alae , a process probably complete by the time the general Marius assumed command in 107 BC. (The so-called \" Marian reforms \" of the army hypothesised by some scholars are today seen by other scholars as having evolved earlier and more gradually.) In the period after the defeat of Carthage in 201 BC, the army was campaigning exclusively outside Italy, resulting in its men being away from their home plots of land for many years at a stretch. They were assuaged by the large amounts of booty that they shared after victories in the rich eastern theatre. But in Italy, the ever-increasing concentration of public lands in the hands of big landowners, and the consequent displacement of the soldiers' families, led to great unrest and demands for land redistribution. This was successfully achieved, but resulted in the disaffection of Rome's Italian allies, who as non-citizens were excluded from the redistribution. This led to the mass revolt of the socii and the Social War (91-88 BC). The result was the grant of Roman citizenship to all Italians and the end of the Polybian army's dual structure: the alae were abolished and the socii recruited into the legions. Imperial Roman army (30 BC – AD 284) Under the founder–emperor Augustus (ruled 30 BC – 14 AD), the legions , c. 5,000-strong all-heavy infantry formations recruited from Roman citizens only, were transformed from a mixed conscript and volunteer corps serving an average of 10 years, to all-volunteer units of long-term professionals serving a standard 25-year term (conscription was only decreed in emergencies). In the later 1st century, the size of a legion's First Cohort was doubled, increasing legionary personnel to c. 5,500. Alongside the legions, Augustus established the auxilia , a regular corps of similar numbers to the legions, recruited from the peregrini (non-citizen inhabitants of the empire – about 90% of the empire's population in the 1st century). As well as comprising large numbers of extra heavy infantry equipped in a similar manner to legionaries, the auxilia provided virtually all the army's cavalry (heavy and light), light infantry, archers and other specialists . The auxilia were organised in c. 500-strong units called cohortes (all-infantry), alae (all-cavalry) and cohortes equitatae (infantry with a cavalry contingent attached). Around 80 AD, a minority of auxiliary regiments were doubled in size. Until about 68 AD, the auxilia were recruited by a mix of conscription and voluntary enlistment. After that time, the auxilia became largely a volunteer corps, with conscription resorted to only in emergencies. Auxiliaries were required to serve a minimum of 25 years, although many served for longer periods. On completion of their minimum term, auxiliaries were awarded Roman citizenship, which carried important legal, fiscal and social advantages. Alongside the regular forces, the army of the Principate employed allied native units (called numeri ) from outside the empire on a mercenary basis. These were led by their own aristocrats and equipped in traditional fashion. Numbers fluctuated according to circumstances and are largely unknown. As all-citizen formations, and symbolic guarantors of the dominance of the Italian hegemony, [ citation needed ] legions enjoyed greater social prestige than the auxilia. This was reflected in better pay and benefits. In addition, legionaries were equipped with more expensive and protective armour than auxiliaries. However, in 212, the emperor Caracalla granted Roman citizenship to all the empire's inhabitants. At this point, the distinction between legions and auxilia became moot, the latter becoming all-citizen units also. The change was reflected in the disappearance, during the 3rd century, of legionaries' special equipment, and the progressive break-up of legions into cohort-sized units like the auxilia. By the end of Augustus' reign, the imperial army numbered some 250,000 men, equally split between legionaries and auxiliaries (25 legions and c. 250 auxiliary regiments). The numbers grew to a peak of about 450,000 by 211 (33 legions and c. 400 auxiliary regiments). By then, auxiliaries outnumbered legionaries substantially. From the peak, numbers probably underwent a steep decline by 270 due to plague and losses during multiple major barbarian invasions. Numbers were restored to their early 2nd-century level of c. 400,000 (but probably not to their 211 peak) under Diocletian (r. 284–305). After the empire's borders became settled (on the Rhine - Danube line in Europe) by 68, virtually all military units (except the Praetorian Guard ) were stationed on or near the borders, in roughly 17 of the 42 provinces of the empire in the reign of Hadrian (r. 117–138). The military chain of command was relatively uniform across the Empire. In each province, the deployed legions' legati (legion commanders, who also controlled the auxiliary regiments attached to their legion) reported to the legatus Augusti pro praetore (provincial governor), who also headed the civil administration. The governor in turn reported directly to the emperor in Rome. There was no army general staff in Rome, but the leading praefectus praetorio (commander of the Praetorian Guard ) often acted as the emperor's de facto military chief-of-staff. Legionary rankers were relatively well-paid, compared to contemporary common labourers. Compared with their subsistence-level peasant families, they enjoyed considerable disposable income, enhanced by periodic cash bonuses on special occasions such as the accession of a new emperor. In addition, on completion of their term of service, they were given a generous discharge bonus equivalent to 13 years' salary. Auxiliaries were paid much less in the early 1st century, but by 100 AD, the differential had virtually disappeared. Similarly, in the earlier period, auxiliaries appear not to have received cash and discharge bonuses, but probably did so from Hadrian onwards. Junior officers ( principales ), the equivalent of non-commissioned officers in modern armies, could expect to earn up to twice basic pay. Legionary centurions , the equivalent of mid-level commissioned officers, were organised in an elaborate hierarchy. Usually risen from the ranks, they commanded the legion's tactical sub-units of centuriae (c. 80 men) and cohorts (c. 480 men). They were paid several multiples of basic pay. The most senior centurion, the primus pilus , was elevated to equestrian rank upon completion of his single-year term of office. The senior officers of the army, the legati legionis (legion commanders), tribuni militum (legion staff officers) and the praefecti (commanders of auxiliary regiments) were all of at least equestrian rank. In the 1st and early 2nd centuries, they were mainly Italian aristocrats performing the military component of their cursus honorum (conventional career path). Later, provincial career officers became predominant. Senior officers were paid very high salaries, multiples of at least 50 times basic. A typical Roman army during this period consisted of five to six legions. One legion was made up of ten cohorts. The first cohort had five centuria each of 160 soldiers. In the second through tenth cohorts there were six centuria of 80 men each. These do not include archers, cavalry or officers. Soldiers spent only a fraction of their lives on campaign. Most of their time was spent on routine military duties such as training, patrolling, and maintenance of equipment, etc. Soldiers also played an important role outside the military sphere. They performed the function of a provincial governor's police force. As a large, disciplined and skilled force of fit men, they played a crucial role in the construction of a province's Roman military and civil infrastructure: in addition to constructing forts and fortified defences such as Hadrian's Wall , they built roads, bridges, ports, public buildings, entire new cities (Roman colonies), and also engaged in large-scale forest clearance and marsh drainage to expand the province's available arable land. Soldiers, mostly drawn from polytheistic societies, enjoyed wide freedom of worship in the polytheistic Roman system. They revered their own native deities, Roman deities and the local deities of the provinces in which they served. Only a few religions were banned by the Roman authorities, as being incompatible with the official Roman religion and/or politically subversive, notably Druidism and Christianity . The later Principate saw the rise in popularity among the military of Eastern mystery cults , generally centred on one deity, and involving secret rituals divulged only to initiates. By far the most popular in the army was Mithraism , an apparently syncretist religion which mainly originated in Asia Minor . Late Roman army/East Roman army (284–641) The Late Roman army is the term used to denote the military forces of the Roman Empire from the accession of emperor Diocletian in 284 until the Empire's definitive division into Eastern and Western halves in 395. A few decades afterwards, the Western army disintegrated as the Western Empire collapsed. The East Roman army , on the other hand, continued intact and essentially unchanged until its reorganization by themes and transformation into the Byzantine army in the 7th century. The term late Roman army is often used to include the East Roman army. The army of the Principate underwent a significant transformation, as a result of the chaotic 3rd century . Unlike the Principate army, the army of the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were more poorly remunerated than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries. The size of the 4th-century army is controversial. More dated scholars (e.g. A. H. M. Jones , writing in the 1960s) estimated the late army as much larger than the Principate army, half the size again or even as much as twice the size. With the benefit of archaeological discoveries of recent decades, many contemporary historians view the late army as no larger than its predecessor: under Diocletian c. 390,000 (the same as under Hadrian almost two centuries earlier) and under Constantine no greater, and probably somewhat smaller, than the Principate peak of c. 440,000. The main change in structure was the establishment of large armies that accompanied the emperors ( comitatus praesentales ) and were generally based away from the frontiers. Their primary function was to deter usurpations . The legions were split up into smaller units comparable in size to the auxiliary regiments of the Principate. In parallel, legionary armour and equipment were abandoned in favour of auxiliary equipment. Infantry adopted the more protective equipment of the Principate cavalry. The role of cavalry in the late army does not appear to have been enhanced as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2nd century and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. Indeed, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles in mid-4th century. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence. The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the upgrading of many existing border forts to make them more defensible, as well as the construction of new forts with much higher defensive specifications. The interpretation of this trend has fuelled an ongoing debate whether the army adopted a defence-in-depth strategy or continued the same posture of \"forward defence\" as in the early Principate. Many elements of the late army's defence posture were similar to those associated with forward defence, such as a looser forward location of forts, frequent cross-border operations, and external buffer-zones of allied barbarian tribes. Whatever the defence strategy, it was apparently less successful in preventing barbarian incursions than in the 1st and 2nd centuries. This may have been due to heavier barbarian pressure, and/or to the practice of keeping large armies of the best troops in the interior, depriving the border forces of sufficient support. Byzantine army (641–1081) Komnenian Byzantine army (1081–1204) The Komnenian period marked a rebirth of the Byzantine army . At the beginning of the Komnenian period in 1081, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent. Surrounded by enemies, and financially ruined by a long period of civil war, the empire's prospects looked grim. At the beginning of the Komnenian period, the Byzantine army was reduced to a shadow of its former self: during the 11th century, decades of peace and neglect had reduced the old thematic forces, and the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had destroyed the professional tagmata , the core of the Byzantine army. At Manzikert and later at Dyrrhachium , units tracing their lineage for centuries back to Late Roman army were wiped out, and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor deprived the Empire of its main recruiting ground. In the Balkans, at the same time, the Empire was exposed to invasions by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily , and by Pecheneg raids across the Danube . The Byzantine army's nadir was reached in 1091, when Alexios I Komnenos could manage to field only 500 soldiers from the Empire's professional forces. These formed the nucleus of the army, with the addition of the armed retainers of Alexios' relatives and the nobles enrolled in the army and the substantial aid of a large force of allied Cumans , which won the Battle of Levounion against the Pechenegs (Petcheneks or Patzinaks). [ 4 ] Yet, through a combination of skill, determination and years of campaigning, Alexios, John and Manuel Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire by constructing a new army from scratch. This process should not, however, at least in its earlier phases, be seen as a planned exercise in military restructuring. In particular, Alexios I was often reduced to reacting to events rather than controlling them; the changes he made to the Byzantine army were largely done out of immediate necessity and were pragmatic in nature. The new force had a core of units which were both professional and disciplined. It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangians , the Athanatoi , a unit of heavy cavalry stationed in Constantinople , the Vardariotai and the Archontopouloi , recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers, foreign mercenary regiments, and also units of professional soldiers recruited from the provinces. These provincial troops included kataphraktoi cavalry from Macedonia, Thessaly and Thrace, and various other provincial forces such as Trebizond archers from the Black Sea coast of Anatolia . Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state the Komnenian army included the armed followers of members of the wider imperial family and its extensive connections. In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military. The granting of pronoia holdings, where land, or more accurately rights to revenue from land, was held in return for military obligations, was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure towards the end of the Komnenian period, though it became much more important subsequently. In 1097, the Byzantine army numbered around 70,000 men altogether. [ 5 ] By 1180 and the death of Manuel Komnenos, whose frequent campaigns had been on a grand scale, the army was probably considerably larger. During the reign of Alexios I, the field army numbered around 20,000 men which was increased to about 30,000 men in John II's reign. [ 6 ] By the end of Manuel I's reign the Byzantine field army had risen to 40,000 men. Palaiologan Byzantine army (1261–1453) The Palaiologan army refers to the military forces of the Byzantine Empire from the late 13th century to its final collapse in the mid 15th century, under the House of the Palaiologoi . The army was a direct continuation of the forces of the Nicaean army, which itself was a fractured component of the formidable Komnenian army . Under the first Palaiologan emperor, Michael VIII, the army's role took an increasingly offensive role whilst the naval forces of the Empire, weakened since the days of Andronikos I Komnenos, were boosted to include thousands of skilled sailors and some 80 ships. Due to the lack of land to support the army, the Empire required the use of large numbers of mercenaries. After Andronikos II took to the throne, the army fell apart and the Byzantines suffered regular defeats at the hands of their eastern opponents, although they would continue to enjoy success against the crusader territories in Greece. By c. 1350, following a destructive civil war and the outbreak of the Black Death , the Empire was no longer capable of raising troops and the supplies to maintain them. The Empire came to rely upon troops provided by Serbs, Bulgarians, Venetians, Latins, Genoans and Ottoman Turks to fight the civil wars that lasted for the greater part of the 14th century, with the latter foe being the most successful in establishing a foothold in Thrace. The Ottomans swiftly expanded through the Balkans and cut off Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, from the surrounding land. The last decisive battle was fought by the Palaiologan army in 1453, when Constantinople was besieged and fell on 29 May. The last isolated remnants of the Byzantine state were conquered by 1461.

        "content": "A combat medic is responsible for providing emergency medical treatment at a point of wounding in a combat or training environment, as well as primary care and health protection and evacuation from a point of injury or illness. Additionally, medics may also be responsible for the creation, oversight, and execution of long-term patient care plans in consultation with or in the absence of a readily available doctor or advanced practice provider. Combat medics may be used in hospitals and clinics, where they have the opportunity to work in additional roles, such as operating medical and laboratory equipment and performing and assisting with procedures. Canada Training All Regular Force Medical Technicians begin training with the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec . [ 1 ] Then they begin Occupational training at The Canadian Forces Health Services Training Centre in Borden, Ontario , where they are taught how to maintain medical supplies and equipment, screen patients, implement patient care plans, treat medical conditions, administer diagnostic procedures, medications, and continuous infusions. They also learn how to manage airways and assist with minor surgical procedures setting up deployed medical facilities and treating casualties in an operational and CBRNE environment over the course of 47-48 weeks. They also earn the Primary Care Paramedic Level 1 certification. Advanced training can include, Preventive Medicine, Biomedical electronics, and Aviation Physiology, among others. Assignments Medical Technicians may be posted to any Canadian ship, or base as part of the base emergency response or as part of a clinic or hospital. They can also be deployed as the medical detachment of an infantry platoon, as part of a MEDEVAC helicopter team, or on a naval vessel. [ 2 ] It is customary for soldiers to refer to their platoon medic as \"Doc\", similar to the US tradition. United States Training and certifications All military medical training in the United States takes place at Joint Base San Antonio , Fort Sam Houston , Texas . Here, among other medical jobs, Army Combat Medics, Air Force Medical Technicians, and Navy Hospital Corpsman complete their respective medical training programs. While there are similarities in the training and skills, each branch also incorporates training specific to their services’ needs and mission. Although Combat Medics are certified at the Emergency Medical Technician level upon graduation, their scope of practice often parallels and sometimes surpasses that of a paramedic . Their scope is expanded upon by the medical provider(s) assigned to the unit, who oversees the protocols and training of assigned medical personnel. Army medics follow a career progression sequence, wherein each rank above Specialist /Corporal (E4) comes with additional required knowledge, skills, and competencies. Medics remain very versatile and may even diagnose illnesses and perform procedures usually performed by Physician Assistants , Nurse Practitioners , and Physicians. Combat Paramedic Course, Special Operations Combat Medic Course, Prolonged Field Care Course, Flight Medic/Critical Care Course, and advanced Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) such as cadaver labs are some of the educational opportunities available to medics as they progress, which include the use of goats as training aids due to their similarity to human physiology. [ 3 ] Although most of the training translates into civilian certifications/licenses, medics often train and practice on skills and with medications outside of their civilian counterparts' scope of practice. Many programs are dedicated to and who provide preference for military medics transitioning into Paramedic, Registered Nurse (RN), and Physician Assistant (PA) educations. Assignments Medics may also be assigned to combat support hospital units, forward surgical teams , and military treatment facilities and clinics where they can fulfill almost any role, from administrative duties to laboratory and medical equipment operations. When assigned to non-medical field units such as infantry , armored cavalry , artillery , combat engineers and military police , the personnel of the medical platoon are organic to the Headquarters and Headquarters Company /Detachment. The platoon is usually composed of three sections: Ambulance/Evac Section, Combat Medic/Line Medic Section, and the BAS/Treatment section. Each section is led by team leader, and the scope of practice all falls under the medical providers. Ambulance/Evac medics function just like a civilian ambulance would. They are responsible for responding to and transporting patients from a point of injury to, as well as between medical care facilities. The Battalion Aid Station (BAS)/Treatment Medics function similar to an urgent care/ small emergency department depending on size and resources. Under the direction of the medical provider and team leaders or sergeants, they intake, triage, and stabilize or treat patients for transfer to another tier or discharge. Battalion Aid Stations are more mobile than Combat Support Hospitals , but have less resources available. They are intended to move as the unit advances, whereas a Combat Support Hospital would have a more long-term fixed position. Line medics are the most independent of the 3. Although they belong to Headquarters, they are attached to other platoons within a company and oversee the medical care of the soldiers assigned to them which can be anywhere from 30 to 60 Soldiers. They become a part of the group they are assigned to and with the exception of a few tasks, they do everything that their assigned soldiers do from training to missions. They are the ones who would be the first to treat an injured person and direct their immediate medical care, and are often the first to recognize when something is wrong with one of their soldiers because they spend so much time with them. They may also be the subject matter expert in advising leaders of medical planning for missions. Their co-location with the troops they are assigned allows them to easily monitor ongoing health. Being a line medic requires them to carry whatever a regular soldier carries, in addition to an aid bag and other medical supplies. These medics must be very physically fit, and able to function well in highly stressful tactical situations. They are expected to be very independent and function on their own as extensions of the provider. They make field diagnosis and manage the conditions appropriately, deferring to the provider when necessary. In the U.S. armed forces, service members in line units often refer to their assigned combat medic or hospital corpsman as \"Doc.\" Geneva Convention protection In 1864, sixteen European states adopted the first-ever Geneva Convention to save lives and alleviate the suffering of wounded and sick persons in the battlefield , as well as to protect trained medical personnel as non-combatants , in the act of rendering aid. Chapter IV, Article 25 of the Geneva Convention states that: \"Members of the armed forces specially trained for employment, should the need arise, as hospital orderlies, nurses or auxiliary stretcher-bearers, in the search for or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded and sick shall likewise be respected and protected if they are carrying out these duties at the time when they come into contact with the enemy or fall into his hands.\" Article 29 reads: \"Members of the personnel designated in Article 25 who have fallen into the hands of the enemy, shall be prisoners of war , but shall be employed on their medical duties insofar as the need arises.\" According to the Geneva Convention, knowingly firing at a medic wearing clear insignia is a war crime . [ 4 ] In modern times, most combat medics carry a personal weapon, to be used to protect themselves and the wounded or sick in their care. [ 5 ] By convention this is limited to small arms (including rifles). During World War II, for example, Allied medics serving the European and Mediterranean areas usually carried the M1911A1 pistol while those serving the Pacific theater carried pistols or M1 carbines . [ 6 ] The German medics (Sanitätssoldaten) in medical units were issued with the standard-issue Kar98K , while the infantry level stretcher-bearers (Krankenträgern) and medical NCOs (Sanitätsunteroffiziere) were issued Luger or Walther pistols. When and if they use their arms offensively, they then sacrifice their protection under the Geneva Conventions . [ 7 ] In today's combat environment, non-conventional forces frequently do not follow the Geneva Conventions, and deliberately target medical personnel identified by their equipment or insignia. Consequently, based on the tactical environment, medics in some armies carry a standard-issue rifle in addition to their pistol. History The Roman Army used combat medics which were referred to as Capsarii after the box (capsa) of bandages which they carried. Forts could also have hospitals integrated into their designs. [ 8 ] Surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey directed the Grande Armée of Napoleon to develop mobile field hospitals, or ambulances volantes ('flying ambulances'), in addition to a corps of trained and equipped soldiers ( infirmiers tenues de service ) to aid those on the battlefield. Before Larrey's initiative in the 1790s, wounded soldiers were either left amid the fighting until the combat ended or their comrades would carry them to the rear line. During the American Civil War , musicians had the double duty of acting as stretcher-bearers to move the wounded to field hospitals and assisting surgeons operating on patients. However, the results of using musicians as medical assistants were uneven, and while some became adept in the role others were more hindrance than help. [ 9 ] Surgeon ( Major ) Jonathan Letterman , Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac , realized a need for an integrated medical treatment and evacuation system, equipped with dedicated vehicles, organizations, facilities, and personnel. The Letterman plan for a dedicated ambulance corps was first implemented in September 1862 at the Battle of Antietam , Maryland, where it proved its worth. Soon the U.S. Ambulance Corps became an integral part of the Union Army . The Confederate States Army also implemented an ambulance corps, but it was plagued with shortages of men and materiel, making its job more difficult. [ 10 ] The United States Army's need for medical and scientific specialty officers to support combat operations resulted in the creation of two temporary components: the U.S. Army Ambulance Service , established on June 23, 1917, and the Sanitary Corps, established on June 30, 1917. Officers of the Sanitary Corps served in medical logistics, hospital administration, patient administration, resource management, x-ray, laboratory engineering, physical reconstruction, gas defense, and venereal disease control. They were dedicated members of the medical team that enabled American generals to concentrate on enemy threats rather than epidemic threats. On August 4, 1947, Congress created the Navy Medical Service Corps . [ 11 ] In the United States, a report entitled \" Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society (1966) \", was published by National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council . Better known as \"The White Paper\" to emergency providers, it revealed that soldiers who were seriously wounded on the battlefields of Vietnam had a better survival rate than those individuals who were seriously injured in motor vehicle accidents on California freeways. Early research attributed these differences in outcome to a number of factors, including comprehensive trauma care, rapid transport to designated trauma facilities, and a new type of medical corpsman, one who was trained to perform certain critical advanced medical procedures such as fluid replacement and airway management, which allowed the victim to survive the journey to definitive care. Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Star of David The International Committee of the Red Cross , a private humanitarian institution based in Switzerland, provided the first official symbol for medical personnel. The first Geneva Convention, originally called for \"Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field\", officially adopted the red cross on a field of white as the identifying emblem. This symbol was meant to signify to enemy combatants that the medic qualifies as a non-combatant, at least while providing medical care. [ 12 ] Islamic countries use a Red Crescent instead, originating from the Russo-Turkish War , when the Ottoman Empire declared that it would use a red crescent instead of a red cross as its emblem, although it agreed to respect the red cross used by the opposing Russian Empire . Although these symbols were officially sponsored by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , the Magen David Adom , Israel's emergency relief service, use the \"Magen David\", a red star of David on a white background. To enable the MDA to become a fully recognized and participating member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Protocol III was adopted, authorizing the use of the Red Crystal . For indicative use on foreign territory, any national society can incorporate its unique symbol into the Red Crystal. Under Protocol III, the MDA continues to employ the red Magen David for domestic use, and employs the Red Crystal on international relief missions. Modern day Medical personnel from most Western nations carry weapons for protection of themselves and their patients but remain designated non-combatants, wearing the red cross, crescent or crystal. United States In the United States Armed Forces, MEDEVAC vehicles display a large Red Cross on a white background. However, ground forces do not display this due to increased targeting of medical personnel by insurgents. [ 13 ] Traditionally, most United States medical personnel also wore a distinguishing red cross, to denote their protection as non-combatants under the Geneva Convention. This practice continued into World War II . However, the enemies faced by professional armies in more recent conflicts are often insurgents who either do not recognize the Geneva Convention or choose not to adhere to it, and thus readily engage all personnel, irrespective of non-combatant status. As their non-combatant status is not respected, many US medics no longer wear non-combatant markings. This can enable medics to be used as medically trained soldiers, fighting aggressively rather than just in self-defence. [ 14 ] Combat Medics in the United States Army and United States Navy Hospital Corpsmen are virtually indistinguishable from regular combat troops, except for the extra medical equipment they carry. The modern-day interpretation of the U.S. Army doctrine requires medics to carry one primary weapon and, if possible, a secondary weapon. [ 15 ] It is also common to find American combat medics who are no longer wearing the red or white cross because it is considered unethical to do so when the combat medic is carrying a weapon and could engage in actual combat. [ 16 ] As a result of the 2005 BRAC , the U.S. Department of Defense has moved most medical training for all branches of the armed forces to Fort Sam Houston of Joint Base San Antonio . [ 17 ] China Before the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam , the People's Liberation Army did not employ armoured ambulances, leading to difficulties in evacuation casualties from the front lines. To fill this gap, the PLA first developed the WZ750 armored ambulance based on the Type-81 tracked armored command vehicle, and later on the WZ751 and WZ 753 vehicles. [ 18 ] In addition to combat roles, PLA medics have been deployed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 19 ] Germany Following German rearmament in the 1950s, the medical service was reestablished based on the traditional structure, with a medical service for each military branch. [ 20 ] This changed in 2002, when the medical services were largely merged to form the Joint Medical Service . Since 2002, most of the former responsibilities of the Army Medical Service have been transferred to the Joint Medical Service, although the entity still exists as a much smaller organisation within the German military.
